<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the publication of his
&ldquo;Table Talk&rdquo; and other poems in March, 1782, William
Cowper, in his quiet retirement at Olney, under Mrs.
Unwin&rsquo;s care, found a new friend in Lady Austen.&nbsp; She
was a baronet&rsquo;s widow who had a sister married to a
clergyman near Olney, with whom Cowper was slightly
acquainted.&nbsp; In the summer of 1781, when his first volume
was being printed, Cowper met Lady Austen and her sister in the
street at Olney, and persuaded Mrs. Unwin to invite them to
tea.&nbsp; Their coming was the beginning of a cordial
friendship.&nbsp; Lady Austen, without being less earnest, had a
liveliness that satisfied Cowper&rsquo;s sense of fun to an
extent that stirred at last some jealousy in Mrs. Unwin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She had lived much in France,&rdquo; Cowper said,
&ldquo;was very sensible, and had infinite vivacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vicar of Olney was in difficulties, with his affairs in
the hands of trustees. The duties of his office were entirely
discharged by a curate, and the vicarage was to let.&nbsp; Lady
Austen, in 1782, rented it, to be near her new friends.&nbsp;
There was only a wall between the garden of the house occupied by
Cowper and Mrs. Unwin and the vicarage garden.&nbsp; A door was
made in the wall, and there was a close companionship of
three.&nbsp; When Lady Austen did not spend her evenings with
Mrs. Unwin and Cowper, Mrs. Unwin and Cowper spent their evenings
with Lady Austen.&nbsp; They read, talked, Lady Austen played and
sang, and they all called one another by their Christian names,
William, Mary (Mrs. Unwin), and Anna (Lady Austen).&nbsp; In a
poetical epistle to Lady Austen, written in December, 1781,
Cowper closes a reference to the strength of their friendship
with the evidence it gave,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That Solomon has wisely spoken,&mdash;<br
/>
&lsquo;A threefold cord is not soon broken.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One evening in the summer of 1782, when Cowper was
low-spirited, Lady Austen told him in lively fashion the story
upon which he founded the ballad of &ldquo;John
Gilpin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its original hero is said to have been a Mr.
Bayer, who had a draper&rsquo;s shop in London, at the corner of
Cheapside.&nbsp; Cowper was so much tickled by it, that he lay
awake part of the night rhyming and laughing, and by the next
evening the ballad was complete.&nbsp; It was sent to Mrs.
Unwin&rsquo;s son, who sent it to the Public Advertiser, where
for the next two or three years it lay buried in the
&ldquo;Poets&rsquo; Corner,&rdquo; and attracted no particular
attention.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1783, when one of the three friends had been
reading blank verse aloud to the other two, Lady Austen, from her
seat upon the sofa, urged upon Cowper, as she had urged before,
that blank verse was to be preferred to the rhymed couplets in
which his first book had been written, and that he should write a
poem in blank verse.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;if you will give me a subject.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;you can write upon
anything.&nbsp; Write on this sofa.&rdquo;&nbsp; He playfully
accepted that as &ldquo;the task&rdquo; set him, and began his
poem called &ldquo;The Task,&rdquo; which was finished in the
summer of the next year, 1784.&nbsp; But before &ldquo;The
Task&rdquo; was finished, Mrs. Unwin&rsquo;s jealousy obliged
Cowper to give up his new friend&mdash;whom he had made a point
of calling upon every morning at eleven&mdash;and prevent her
return to summer quarters in the vicarage.</p>
<p>Two miles from Olney was Weston Underwood with a park, to
which its owner gave Cowper the use of a key.&nbsp; In 1782 a
younger brother, John Throckmorton, came with his wife to live at
Weston, and continued Cowper&rsquo;s privilege.&nbsp; The
Throckmortons were Roman Catholics, but in May, 1784, Mr. Unwin
was tempted by an invitation to see a balloon ascent from their
park.&nbsp; Their kindness as hosts won upon Cowper; they sought
and had his more intimate friendship, till in his correspondence
he playfully abused the first syllable of their name and called
them Mr. and Mrs. Frog.</p>
<p>Cowper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Task&rdquo; went to its publisher and
printing was begun, when suddenly &ldquo;John Gilpin,&rdquo;
after a long sleep in the Public Advertiser, rode triumphant
through the town.&nbsp; A favourite actor of the day was giving
recitations at Freemason&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; A man of letters,
Richard Sharp, who had read and liked &ldquo;John Gilpin,&rdquo;
pointed out to the actor how well it would suit his
purpose.&nbsp; The actor was John Henderson, whose Hamlet,
Shylock, Richard III., and Falstaff were the most popular of his
day.&nbsp; He died suddenly in 1785, at the age of thirty-eight,
and it was thus in the last year of his life that his power of
recitation drew &ldquo;John Gilpin&rdquo; from obscurity and made
it the nine days&rsquo; wonder of the town.&nbsp; Pictures of
John Gilpin abounded in all forms.&nbsp; He figured on
pocket-handkerchiefs.&nbsp; When the publisher asked for a few
more pages to his volume of &ldquo;The Task,&rdquo; Cowper gave
him as makeweights an &ldquo;Epistle to Joseph Hill,&rdquo; his
&ldquo;Tirocinium,&rdquo; and, a little doubtfully, &ldquo;John
Gilpin.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the book was published in June, 1785; was
sought by many because it was by the author of &ldquo;John
Gilpin,&rdquo; and at once won recognition. The preceding volume
had not made Cowper famous.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Task&rdquo; at once
gave him his place among the poets.</p>
<p>Cowper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Task&rdquo; is to this day, except
Wordsworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Excursion,&rdquo; the best purely
didactic poem in the English language.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Sofa&rdquo; stands only as a point of departure:&mdash;it
suits a gouty limb; but as the poet is not gouty, he is up and
off.&nbsp; He is off for a walk with Mrs. Unwin in the country
about Olney.&nbsp; He dwells on the rural sights and rural
sounds, taking first the inanimate sounds, then the
animate.&nbsp; In muddy winter weather he walks alone, finds a
solitary cottage, and draws from it comment upon the false
sentiment of solitude.&nbsp; He describes the walk to the park at
Weston Underwood, the prospect from the hilltop, touches upon his
privilege in having a key of the gate, describes the avenues of
trees, the wilderness, the grove, and the sound of the
thresher&rsquo;s flail then suggests to him that all live by
energy, best ease is after toil.&nbsp; He compares the luxury of
art with wholesomeness of Nature free to all, that brings health
to the sick, joy to the returned seafarer.&nbsp; Spleen vexes
votaries of artificial life.&nbsp; True gaiety is for the
innocent.&nbsp; So thought flows on, and touches in its course
the vital questions of a troubled time.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Task&rdquo; appeared four years before the outbreak of the French
Revolution, and is in many passages not less significant of
rising storms than the &ldquo;Excursion&rdquo; is significant of
what came with the breaking of the clouds.</p>

<h3>BOOK I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE SOFA.</span></h3>
<p>[&ldquo;The history of the following production is briefly
this:&mdash;A lady, fond of blank verse, demanded a poem of that
kind from the author, and gave him the <span
class="smcap">Sofa</span> for a subject.&nbsp; He obeyed, and
having much leisure, connected another subject with it; and,
pursuing the train of thought to which his situation and turn of
mind led him, brought forth, at length, instead of the trifle
which he at first intended, a serious affair&mdash;a
volume.&rdquo;]</p>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">sing</span> the
Sofa.&nbsp; I, who lately sang<br />
Truth, Hope, and Charity, and touched with awe<br />
The solemn chords, and with a trembling hand,<br />
Escaped with pain from that advent&rsquo;rous flight,<br />
Now seek repose upon a humbler theme:<br />
The theme though humble, yet august and proud<br />
The occasion&mdash;for the Fair commands the song.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was, when clothing
sumptuous or for use,<br />
Save their own painted skins, our sires had none.<br />
As yet black breeches were not; satin smooth,<br />
Or velvet soft, or plush with shaggy pile:<br />
The hardy chief upon the rugged rock<br />
Washed by the sea, or on the gravelly bank<br />
Thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud,<br />
Fearless of wrong, reposed his weary strength.<br />
Those barbarous ages past, succeeded next<br />
The birthday of invention; weak at first,<br />
Dull in design, and clumsy to perform.<br />
Joint-stools were then created; on three legs<br />
Upborne they stood. Three legs upholding firm<br />
A massy slab, in fashion square or round.<br />
On such a stool immortal Alfred sat,<br />
And swayed the sceptre of his infant realms;<br />
And such in ancient halls and mansions drear<br />
May still be seen, but perforated sore<br />
And drilled in holes the solid oak is found,<br />
By worms voracious eating through and through.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length a generation more
refined<br />
Improved the simple plan, made three legs four,<br />
Gave them a twisted form vermicular,<br />
And o&rsquo;er the seat, with plenteous wadding stuffed,<br />
Induced a splendid cover green and blue,<br />
Yellow and red, of tapestry richly wrought<br />
And woven close, or needlework sublime.<br />
There might ye see the peony spread wide,<br />
The full-blown rose, the shepherd and his lass,<br />
Lapdog and lambkin with black staring eyes,<br />
And parrots with twin cherries in their beak.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now came the cane from India,
smooth and bright<br />
With Nature&rsquo;s varnish; severed into stripes<br />
That interlaced each other, these supplied,<br />
Of texture firm, a lattice-work that braced<br />
The new machine, and it became a chair.<br />
But restless was the chair; the back erect<br />
Distressed the weary loins that felt no ease;<br />
The slippery seat betrayed the sliding part<br />
That pressed it, and the feet hung dangling down,<br />
Anxious in vain to find the distant floor.<br />
These for the rich: the rest, whom fate had placed<br />
In modest mediocrity, content<br />
With base materials, sat on well-tanned hides<br />
Obdurate and unyielding, glassy smooth,<br />
With here and there a tuft of crimson yarn,<br />
Or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixed:<br />
If cushion might be called, what harder seemed<br />
Than the firm oak of which the frame was formed.<br />
No want of timber then was felt or feared<br />
In Albion&rsquo;s happy isle.&nbsp; The lumber stood<br />
Ponderous, and fixed by its own massy weight.<br />
But elbows still were wanting; these, some say,<br />
An alderman of Cripplegate contrived,<br />
And some ascribe the invention to a priest<br />
Burly and big, and studious of his ease.<br />
But rude at first, and not with easy slope<br />
Receding wide, they pressed against the ribs,<br />
And bruised the side, and elevated high<br />
Taught the raised shoulders to invade the ears.<br />
Long time elapsed or e&rsquo;er our rugged sires<br />
Complained, though incommodiously pent in,<br />
And ill at ease behind.&nbsp; The ladies first<br />
Gan murmur, as became the softer sex.<br />
Ingenious fancy, never better pleased<br />
Than when employed to accommodate the fair,<br />
Heard the sweet moan with pity, and devised<br />
The soft settee; one elbow at each end,<br />
And in the midst an elbow, it received,<br />
United yet divided, twain at once.<br />
So sit two kings of Brentford on one throne;<br />
And so two citizens who take the air,<br />
Close packed and smiling in a chaise and one.<br />
But relaxation of the languid frame<br />
By soft recumbency of outstretched limbs,<br />
Was bliss reserved for happier days; so slow<br />
The growth of what is excellent, so hard<br />
To attain perfection in this nether world.<br />
Thus first necessity invented stools,<br />
Convenience next suggested elbow-chairs,<br />
And luxury the accomplished Sofa last.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nurse sleeps sweetly,
hired to watch the sick,<br />
Whom snoring she disturbs.&nbsp; As sweetly he<br />
Who quits the coach-box at the midnight hour<br />
To sleep within the carriage more secure,<br />
His legs depending at the open door.<br />
Sweet sleep enjoys the curate in his desk,<br />
The tedious rector drawling o&rsquo;er his head,<br />
And sweet the clerk below; but neither sleep<br />
Of lazy nurse, who snores the sick man dead,<br />
Nor his who quits the box at midnight hour<br />
To slumber in the carriage more secure,<br />
Nor sleep enjoyed by curate in his desk,<br />
Nor yet the dozings of the clerk are sweet,<br />
Compared with the repose the Sofa yields.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, may I live exempted
(while I live<br />
Guiltless of pampered appetite obscene)<br />
From pangs arthritic that infest the toe<br />
Of libertine excess.&nbsp; The Sofa suits<br />
The gouty limb, &rsquo;tis true; but gouty limb,<br />
Though on a Sofa, may I never feel:<br />
For I have loved the rural walk through lanes<br />
Of grassy swarth, close cropped by nibbling sheep,<br />
And skirted thick with intertexture firm<br />
Of thorny boughs: have loved the rural walk<br />
O&rsquo;er hills, through valleys, and by river&rsquo;s brink,<br
/>
E&rsquo;er since a truant boy I passed my bounds<br />
To enjoy a ramble on the banks of Thames.<br />
And still remember, nor without regret<br />
Of hours that sorrow since has much endeared,<br />
How oft, my slice of pocket store consumed,<br />
Still hungering penniless and far from home,<br />
I fed on scarlet hips and stony haws,<br />
Or blushing crabs, or berries that emboss<br />
The bramble, black as jet, or sloes austere.<br />
Hard fare! but such as boyish appetite<br />
Disdains not, nor the palate undepraved<br />
By culinary arts unsavoury deems.<br />
No Sofa then awaited my return,<br />
No Sofa then I needed.&nbsp; Youth repairs<br />
His wasted spirits quickly, by long toil<br />
Incurring short fatigue; and though our years,<br />
As life declines, speed rapidly away,<br />
And not a year but pilfers as he goes<br />
Some youthful grace that age would gladly keep,<br />
A tooth or auburn lock, and by degrees<br />
Their length and colour from the locks they spare;<br />
The elastic spring of an unwearied foot<br />
That mounts the stile with ease, or leaps the fence,<br />
That play of lungs inhaling and again<br />
Respiring freely the fresh air, that makes<br />
Swift pace or steep ascent no toil to me,<br />
Mine have not pilfered yet; nor yet impaired<br />
My relish of fair prospect; scenes that soothed<br />
Or charmed me young, no longer young, I find<br />
Still soothing and of power to charm me still.<br />
And witness, dear companion of my walks,<br />
Whose arm this twentieth winter I perceive<br />
Fast locked in mine, with pleasure such as love,<br />
Confirmed by long experience of thy worth<br />
And well-tried virtues, could alone inspire&mdash;<br />
Witness a joy that thou hast doubled long.<br />
Thou know&rsquo;st my praise of Nature most sincere,<br />
And that my raptures are not conjured up<br />
To serve occasions of poetic pomp,<br />
But genuine, and art partner of them all.<br />
How oft upon yon eminence, our pace<br />
Has slackened to a pause, and we have borne<br />
The ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew,<br />
While admiration feeding at the eye,<br />
And still unsated, dwelt upon the scene!<br />
Thence with what pleasure have we just discerned<br />
The distant plough slow-moving, and beside<br />
His labouring team, that swerved not from the track,<br />
The sturdy swain diminished to a boy!<br />
Here Ouse, slow winding through a level plain<br />
Of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o&rsquo;er,<br />
Conducts the eye along his sinuous course<br />
Delighted.&nbsp; There, fast rooted in his bank<br />
Stand, never overlooked, our favourite elms<br />
That screen the herdsman&rsquo;s solitary hut;<br />
While far beyond and overthwart the stream<br />
That, as with molten glass, inlays the vale,<br />
The sloping land recedes into the clouds;<br />
Displaying on its varied side the grace<br />
Of hedgerow beauties numberless, square tower,<br />
Tall spire, from which the sound of cheerful bells<br />
Just undulates upon the listening ear;<br />
Groves, heaths, and smoking villages remote.<br />
Scenes must be beautiful which daily viewed<br />
Please daily, and whose novelty survives<br />
Long knowledge and the scrutiny of years:<br />
Praise justly due to those that I describe.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor rural sights alone, but
rural sounds<br />
Exhilarate the spirit, and restore<br />
The tone of languid Nature.&nbsp; Mighty winds,<br />
That sweep the skirt of some far-spreading wood<br />
Of ancient growth, make music not unlike<br />
The dash of ocean on his winding shore,<br />
And lull the spirit while they fill the mind,<br />
Unnumbered branches waving in the blast,<br />
And all their leaves fast fluttering, all at once.<br />
Nor less composure waits upon the roar<br />
Of distant floods, or on the softer voice<br />
Of neighbouring fountain, or of rills that slip<br />
Through the cleft rock, and, chiming as they fall<br />
Upon loose pebbles, lose themselves at length<br />
In matted grass, that with a livelier green<br />
Betrays the secret of their silent course.<br />
Nature inanimate employs sweet sounds,<br />
But animated Nature sweeter still<br />
To soothe and satisfy the human ear.<br />
Ten thousand warblers cheer the day, and one<br />
The livelong night: nor these alone whose notes<br />
Nice-fingered art must emulate in vain,<br />
But cawing rooks, and kites that swim sublime<br />
In still repeated circles, screaming loud,<br />
The jay, the pie, and even the boding owl<br />
That hails the rising moon, have charms for me.<br />
Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh,<br />
Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns,<br />
And only there, please highly for their sake.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace to the artist, whose
ingenious thought<br />
Devised the weather-house, that useful toy!<br />
Fearless of humid air and gathering rains<br />
Forth steps the man&mdash;an emblem of myself!<br />
More delicate his timorous mate retires.<br />
When Winter soaks the fields, and female feet,<br />
Too weak to struggle with tenacious clay,<br />
Or ford the rivulets, are best at home,<br />
The task of new discoveries falls on me.<br />
At such a season and with such a charge<br />
Once went I forth, and found, till then unknown,<br />
A cottage, whither oft we since repair:<br />
&rsquo;Tis perched upon the green hill-top, but close<br />
Environed with a ring of branching elms<br />
That overhang the thatch, itself unseen<br />
Peeps at the vale below; so thick beset<br />
With foliage of such dark redundant growth,<br />
I called the low-roofed lodge the <i>peasant&rsquo;s nest</i>.<br
/>
And hidden as it is, and far remote<br />
From such unpleasing sounds as haunt the ear<br />
In village or in town, the bay of curs<br />
Incessant, clinking hammers, grinding wheels,<br />
And infants clamorous whether pleased or pained,<br />
Oft have I wished the peaceful covert mine.<br />
Here, I have said, at least I should possess<br />
The poet&rsquo;s treasure, silence, and indulge<br />
The dreams of fancy, tranquil and secure.<br />
Vain thought! the dweller in that still retreat<br />
Dearly obtains the refuge it affords.<br />
Its elevated site forbids the wretch<br />
To drink sweet waters of the crystal well;<br />
He dips his bowl into the weedy ditch,<br />
And heavy-laden brings his beverage home,<br />
Far-fetched and little worth: nor seldom waits<br />
Dependent on the baker&rsquo;s punctual call,<br />
To hear his creaking panniers at the door,<br />
Angry and sad and his last crust consumed.<br />
So farewell envy of the <i>peasant&rsquo;s nest</i>.<br />
If solitude make scant the means of life,<br />
Society for me!&nbsp; Thou seeming sweet,<br />
Be still a pleasing object in my view,<br />
My visit still, but never mine abode.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not distant far, a length of
colonnade<br />
Invites us; monument of ancient taste,<br />
Now scorned, but worthy of a better fate.<br />
Our fathers knew the value of a screen<br />
From sultry suns, and, in their shaded walks<br />
And long-protracted bowers, enjoyed at noon<br />
The gloom and coolness of declining day.<br />
We bear our shades about us; self-deprived<br />
Of other screen, the thin umbrella spread,<br />
And range an Indian waste without a tree.<br />
Thanks to Benevolus&mdash;he spares me yet<br />
These chestnuts ranged in corresponding lines,<br />
And, though himself so polished, still reprieves<br />
The obsolete prolixity of shade.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descending now (but cautious,
lest too fast)<br />
A sudden steep, upon a rustic bridge<br />
We pass a gulf, in which the willows dip<br />
Their pendent boughs, stooping as if to drink.<br />
Hence ankle-deep in moss and flowery thyme<br />
We mount again, and feel at every step<br />
Our foot half sunk in hillocks green and soft,<br />
Raised by the mole, the miner of the soil.<br />
He, not unlike the great ones of mankind,<br />
Disfigures earth, and plotting in the dark<br />
Toils much to earn a monumental pile,<br />
That may record the mischiefs he has done.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summit gained, behold the
proud alcove<br />
That crowns it! yet not all its pride secures<br />
The grand retreat from injuries impressed<br />
By rural carvers, who with knives deface<br />
The panels, leaving an obscure rude name<br />
In characters uncouth, and spelt amiss.<br />
So strong the zeal to immortalise himself<br />
Beats in the breast of man, that even a few<br />
Few transient years, won from the abyss abhorred<br />
Of blank oblivion, seem a glorious prize,<br />
And even to a clown.&nbsp; Now roves the eye,<br />
And posted on this speculative height<br />
Exults in its command.&nbsp; The sheepfold here<br />
Pours out its fleecy tenants o&rsquo;er the glebe.<br />
At first, progressive as a stream, they seek<br />
The middle field; but scattered by degrees,<br />
Each to his choice, soon whiten all the land.<br />
There, from the sunburnt hay-field homeward creeps<br />
The loaded wain; while, lightened of its charge,<br />
The wain that meets it passes swiftly by,<br />
The boorish driver leaning o&rsquo;er his team,<br />
Vociferous, and impatient of delay.<br />
Nor less attractive is the woodland scene<br />
Diversified with trees of every growth,<br />
Alike yet various.&nbsp; Here the gray smooth trunks<br />
Of ash, or lime, or beech, distinctly shine,<br />
Within the twilight of their distant shades;<br />
There, lost behind a rising ground, the wood<br />
Seems sunk, and shortened to its topmost boughs.<br />
No tree in all the grove but has its charms,<br />
Though each its hue peculiar; paler some,<br />
And of a wannish gray; the willow such,<br />
And poplar that with silver lines his leaf,<br />
And ash far-stretching his umbrageous arm;<br />
Of deeper green the elm; and deeper still,<br />
Lord of the woods, the long-surviving oak.<br />
Some glossy-leaved and shining in the sun,<br />
The maple, and the beech of oily nuts<br />
Prolific, and the lime at dewy eve<br />
Diffusing odours; nor unnoted pass<br />
The sycamore, capricious in attire,<br />
Now green, now tawny, and ere autumn yet<br />
Have changed the woods, in scarlet honours bright.<br />
O&rsquo;er these, but far beyond (a spacious map<br />
Of hill and valley interposed between),<br />
The Ouse, dividing the well-watered land,<br />
Now glitters in the sun, and now retires,<br />
As bashful, yet impatient to be seen.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the declivity is sharp
and short,<br />
And such the re-ascent; between them weeps<br />
A little Naiad her impoverished urn,<br />
All summer long, which winter fills again.<br />
The folded gates would bar my progress now,<br />
But that the lord of this enclosed demesne,<br />
Communicative of the good he owns,<br />
Admits me to a share: the guiltless eye<br />
Commits no wrong, nor wastes what it enjoys.<br />
Refreshing change! where now the blazing sun?<br />
By short transition we have lost his glare,<br />
And stepped at once into a cooler clime.<br />
Ye fallen avenues! once more I mourn<br />
Your fate unmerited, once more rejoice<br />
That yet a remnant of your race survives.<br />
How airy and how light the graceful arch,<br />
Yet awful as the consecrated roof<br />
Re-echoing pious anthems! while beneath,<br />
The chequered earth seems restless as a flood<br />
Brushed by the wind.&nbsp; So sportive is the light<br />
Shot through the boughs, it dances as they dance,<br />
Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick,<br />
And darkening and enlightening, as the leaves<br />
Play wanton, every moment, every spot.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, with nerves
new-braced and spirits cheered,<br />
We tread the wilderness, whose well-rolled walks,<br />
With curvature of slow and easy sweep&mdash;<br />
Deception innocent&mdash;give ample space<br />
To narrow bounds.&nbsp; The grove receives us next;<br />
Between the upright shafts of whose tall elms<br />
We may discern the thresher at his task.<br />
Thump after thump resounds the constant flail,<br />
That seems to swing uncertain and yet falls<br />
Full on the destined ear.&nbsp; Wide flies the chaff,<br />
The rustling straw sends up a frequent mist<br />
Of atoms, sparkling in the noonday beam.<br />
Come hither, ye that press your beds of down<br />
And sleep not: see him sweating o&rsquo;er his bread<br />
Before he eats it.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis the primal curse,<br />
But softened into mercy; made the pledge<br />
Of cheerful days, and nights without a groan.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By ceaseless action, all that
is subsists.<br />
Constant rotation of the unwearied wheel<br />
That Nature rides upon, maintains her health,<br />
Her beauty, her fertility.&nbsp; She dreads<br />
An instant&rsquo;s pause, and lives but while she moves.<br />
Its own revolvency upholds the world.<br />
Winds from all quarters agitate the air,<br />
And fit the limpid element for use,<br />
Else noxious: oceans, rivers, lakes, and streams<br />
All feel the freshening impulse, and are cleansed<br />
By restless undulation: even the oak<br />
Thrives by the rude concussion of the storm:<br />
He seems indeed indignant, and to feel<br />
The impression of the blast with proud disdain,<br />
Frowning as if in his unconscious arm<br />
He held the thunder.&nbsp; But the monarch owes<br />
His firm stability to what he scorns,<br />
More fixed below, the more disturbed above.<br />
The law, by which all creatures else are bound,<br />
Binds man the lord of all.&nbsp; Himself derives<br />
No mean advantage from a kindred cause,<br />
From strenuous toil his hours of sweetest ease.<br />
The sedentary stretch their lazy length<br />
When custom bids, but no refreshment find,<br />
For none they need: the languid eye, the cheek<br />
Deserted of its bloom, the flaccid, shrunk,<br />
And withered muscle, and the vapid soul,<br />
Reproach their owner with that love of rest<br />
To which he forfeits even the rest he loves.<br />
Not such the alert and active.&nbsp; Measure life<br />
By its true worth, the comforts it affords,<br />
And theirs alone seems worthy of the name<br />
Good health, and, its associate in the most,<br />
Good temper; spirits prompt to undertake,<br />
And not soon spent, though in an arduous task;<br />
The powers of fancy and strong thought are theirs;<br />
Even age itself seems privileged in them<br />
With clear exemption from its own defects.<br />
A sparkling eye beneath a wrinkled front<br />
The veteran shows, and gracing a gray beard<br />
With youthful smiles, descends towards the grave<br />
Sprightly, and old almost without decay.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a coy maiden, Ease, when
courted most,<br />
Farthest retires&mdash;an idol, at whose shrine<br />
Who oftenest sacrifice are favoured least.<br />
The love of Nature and the scene she draws<br />
Is Nature&rsquo;s dictate.&nbsp; Strange, there should be
found<br />
Who, self-imprisoned in their proud saloons,<br />
Renounce the odours of the open field<br />
For the unscented fictions of the loom;<br />
Who, satisfied with only pencilled scenes,<br />
Prefer to the performance of a God<br />
The inferior wonders of an artist&rsquo;s hand.<br />
Lovely indeed the mimic works of Art,<br />
But Nature&rsquo;s works far lovelier.&nbsp; I admire,<br />
None more admires, the painter&rsquo;s magic skill,<br />
Who shows me that which I shall never see,<br />
Conveys a distant country into mine,<br />
And throws Italian light on English walls.<br />
But imitative strokes can do no more<br />
Than please the eye, sweet Nature every sense.<br />
The air salubrious of her lofty hills,<br />
The cheering fragrance of her dewy vales,<br />
And music of her woods&mdash;no works of man<br />
May rival these; these all bespeak a power<br />
Peculiar, and exclusively her own.<br />
Beneath the open sky she spreads the feast;<br />
&rsquo;Tis free to all&mdash;&rsquo;tis ev&rsquo;ry day
renewed,<br />
Who scorns it, starves deservedly at home.<br />
He does not scorn it, who, imprisoned long<br />
In some unwholesome dungeon, and a prey<br />
To sallow sickness, which the vapours dank<br />
And clammy of his dark abode have bred<br />
Escapes at last to liberty and light;<br />
His cheek recovers soon its healthful hue,<br />
His eye relumines its extinguished fires,<br />
He walks, he leaps, he runs&mdash;is winged with joy,<br />
And riots in the sweets of every breeze.<br />
He does not scorn it, who has long endured<br />
A fever&rsquo;s agonies, and fed on drugs.<br />
Nor yet the mariner, his blood inflamed<br />
With acrid salts; his very heart athirst<br />
To gaze at Nature in her green array.<br />
Upon the ship&rsquo;s tall side he stands, possessed<br />
With visions prompted by intense desire;<br />
Fair fields appear below, such as he left<br />
Far distant, such as he would die to find&mdash;<br />
He seeks them headlong, and is seen no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spleen is seldom felt
where Flora reigns;<br />
The lowering eye, the petulance, the frown,<br />
And sullen sadness that o&rsquo;ershade, distort,<br />
And mar the face of beauty, when no cause<br />
For such immeasurable woe appears,<br />
These Flora banishes, and gives the fair<br />
Sweet smiles, and bloom less transient than her own.<br />
It is the constant revolution, stale<br />
And tasteless, of the same repeated joys<br />
That palls and satiates, and makes languid life<br />
A pedlar&rsquo;s pack that bows the bearer down.<br />
Health suffers, and the spirits ebb; the heart<br />
Recoils from its own choice&mdash;at the full feast<br />
Is famished&mdash;finds no music in the song,<br />
No smartness in the jest, and wonders why.<br />
Yet thousands still desire to journey on,<br />
Though halt and weary of the path they tread.<br />
The paralytic, who can hold her cards<br />
But cannot play them, borrows a friend&rsquo;s hand<br />
To deal and shuffle, to divide and sort<br />
Her mingled suits and sequences, and sits<br />
Spectatress both and spectacle, a sad<br />
And silent cipher, while her proxy plays.<br />
Others are dragged into the crowded room<br />
Between supporters; and once seated, sit<br />
Through downright inability to rise,<br />
Till the stout bearers lift the corpse again.<br />
These speak a loud memento.&nbsp; Yet even these<br />
Themselves love life, and cling to it as he,<br />
That overhangs a torrent, to a twig.<br />
They love it, and yet loathe it; fear to die,<br />
Yet scorn the purposes for which they live.<br />
Then wherefore not renounce them?&nbsp; No&mdash;the dread,<br />
The slavish dread of solitude, that breeds<br />
Reflection and remorse, the fear of shame,<br />
And their inveterate habits, all forbid.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom call we gay?&nbsp; That
honour has been long<br />
The boast of mere pretenders to the name.<br />
The innocent are gay&mdash;the lark is gay,<br />
That dries his feathers saturate with dew<br />
Beneath the rosy cloud, while yet the beams<br />
Of day-spring overshoot his humble nest.<br />
The peasant too, a witness of his song,<br />
Himself a songster, is as gay as he.<br />
But save me from the gaiety of those<br />
Whose headaches nail them to a noonday bed;<br />
And save me, too, from theirs whose haggard eyes<br />
Flash desperation, and betray their pangs<br />
For property stripped off by cruel chance;<br />
From gaiety that fills the bones with pain,<br />
The mouth with blasphemy, the heart with woe.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth was made so
various, that the mind<br />
Of desultory man, studious of change,<br />
And pleased with novelty, might be indulged.<br />
Prospects however lovely may be seen<br />
Till half their beauties fade; the weary sight,<br />
Too well acquainted with their smiles, slides off<br />
Fastidious, seeking less familiar scenes.<br />
Then snug enclosures in the sheltered vale,<br />
Where frequent hedges intercept the eye,<br />
Delight us, happy to renounce a while,<br />
Not senseless of its charms, what still we love,<br />
That such short absence may endear it more.<br />
Then forests, or the savage rock may please,<br />
That hides the sea-mew in his hollow clefts<br />
Above the reach of man: his hoary head<br />
Conspicuous many a league, the mariner,<br />
Bound homeward, and in hope already there,<br />
Greets with three cheers exulting.&nbsp; At his waist<br />
A girdle of half-withered shrubs he shows,<br />
And at his feet the baffled billows die.<br />
The common overgrown with fern, and rough<br />
With prickly gorse, that, shapeless and deformed<br />
And dangerous to the touch, has yet its bloom,<br />
And decks itself with ornaments of gold,<br />
Yields no unpleasing ramble; there the turf<br />
Smells fresh, and, rich in odoriferous herbs<br />
And fungous fruits of earth, regales the sense<br />
With luxury of unexpected sweets.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There often wanders one, whom
better days<br />
Saw better clad, in cloak of satin trimmed<br />
With lace, and hat with splendid ribbon bound.<br />
A serving-maid was she, and fell in love<br />
With one who left her, went to sea and died.<br />
Her fancy followed him through foaming waves<br />
To distant shores, and she would sit and weep<br />
At what a sailor suffers; fancy too,<br />
Delusive most where warmest wishes are,<br />
Would oft anticipate his glad return,<br />
And dream of transports she was not to know.<br />
She heard the doleful tidings of his death,<br />
And never smiled again.&nbsp; And now she roams<br />
The dreary waste; there spends the livelong day,<br />
And there, unless when charity forbids,<br />
The livelong night.&nbsp; A tattered apron hides,<br />
Worn as a cloak, and hardly hides, a gown<br />
More tattered still; and both but ill conceal<br />
A bosom heaved with never-ceasing sighs.<br />
She begs an idle pin of all she meets,<br />
And hoards them in her sleeve; but needful food,<br />
Though pressed with hunger oft, or comelier clothes,<br />
Though pinched with cold, asks never.&mdash;Kate is crazed!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see a column of slow-rising
smoke<br />
O&rsquo;ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild.<br />
A vagabond and useless tribe there eat<br />
Their miserable meal.&nbsp; A kettle slung<br />
Between two poles upon a stick transverse,<br />
Receives the morsel; flesh obscene of dog,<br />
Or vermin, or, at best, of cock purloined<br />
From his accustomed perch.&nbsp; Hard-faring race!<br />
They pick their fuel out of every hedge,<br />
Which, kindled with dry leaves, just saves unquenched<br />
The spark of life.&nbsp; The sportive wind blows wide<br />
Their fluttering rags, and shows a tawny skin,<br />
The vellum of the pedigree they claim.<br />
Great skill have they in palmistry, and more<br />
To conjure clean away the gold they touch,<br />
Conveying worthless dross into its place;<br />
Loud when they beg, dumb only when they steal.<br />
Strange! that a creature rational, and cast<br />
In human mould, should brutalise by choice<br />
His nature, and, though capable of arts<br />
By which the world might profit and himself,<br />
Self-banished from society, prefer<br />
Such squalid sloth to honourable toil.<br />
Yet even these, though feigning sickness oft<br />
They swathe the forehead, drag the limping limb,<br />
And vex their flesh with artificial sores,<br />
Can change their whine into a mirthful note<br />
When safe occasion offers, and with dance,<br />
And music of the bladder and the bag,<br />
Beguile their woes, and make the woods resound.<br />
Such health and gaiety of heart enjoy<br />
The houseless rovers of the sylvan world;<br />
And breathing wholesome air, and wandering much,<br />
Need other physic none to heal the effects<br />
Of loathsome diet, penury, and cold.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blest he, though
undistinguished from the crowd<br />
By wealth or dignity, who dwells secure<br />
Where man, by nature fierce, has laid aside<br />
His fierceness, having learnt, though slow to learn<br />
The manners and the arts of civil life.<br />
His wants, indeed, are many; but supply<br />
Is obvious; placed within the easy reach<br />
Of temperate wishes and industrious hands.<br />
Here virtue thrives as in her proper soil;<br />
Not rude and surly, and beset with thorns,<br />
And terrible to sight, as when she springs<br />
(If e&rsquo;er she spring spontaneous) in remote<br />
And barbarous climes, where violence prevails,<br />
And strength is lord of all; but gentle, kind,<br />
By culture tamed, by liberty refreshed,<br />
And all her fruits by radiant truth matured.<br />
War and the chase engross the savage whole;<br />
War followed for revenge, or to supplant<br />
The envied tenants of some happier spot;<br />
The chase for sustenance, precarious trust!<br />
His hard condition with severe constraint<br />
Binds all his faculties, forbids all growth<br />
Of wisdom, proves a school in which he learns<br />
Sly circumvention, unrelenting hate,<br />
Mean self-attachment, and scarce aught beside.<br />
Thus fare the shivering natives of the north,<br />
And thus the rangers of the western world,<br />
Where it advances far into the deep,<br />
Towards the Antarctic.&nbsp; Even the favoured isles<br />
So lately found, although the constant sun<br />
Cheer all their seasons with a grateful smile,<br />
Can boast but little virtue; and inert<br />
Through plenty, lose in morals what they gain<br />
In manners, victims of luxurious ease.<br />
These therefore I can pity, placed remote<br />
From all that science traces, art invents,<br />
Or inspiration teaches; and enclosed<br />
In boundless oceans, never to be passed<br />
By navigators uninformed as they,<br />
Or ploughed perhaps by British bark again.<br />
But far beyond the rest, and with most cause,<br />
Thee, gentle savage! whom no love of thee<br />
Or thine, but curiosity perhaps,<br />
Or else vain-glory, prompted us to draw<br />
Forth from thy native bowers, to show thee here<br />
With what superior skill we can abuse<br />
The gifts of Providence, and squander life.<br />
The dream is past.&nbsp; And thou hast found again<br />
Thy cocoas and bananas, palms, and yams,<br />
And homestall thatched with leaves.&nbsp; But hast thou found<br
/>
Their former charms?&nbsp; And, having seen our state,<br />
Our palaces, our ladies, and our pomp<br />
Of equipage, our gardens, and our sports,<br />
And heard our music; are thy simple friends,<br />
Thy simple fare, and all thy plain delights<br />
As dear to thee as once?&nbsp; And have thy joys<br />
Lost nothing by comparison with ours?<br />
Rude as thou art (for we returned thee rude<br />
And ignorant, except of outward show),<br />
I cannot think thee yet so dull of heart<br />
And spiritless, as never to regret<br />
Sweets tasted here, and left as soon as known.<br />
Methinks I see thee straying on the beach,<br />
And asking of the surge that bathes the foot<br />
If ever it has washed our distant shore.<br />
I see thee weep, and thine are honest tears,<br />
A patriot&rsquo;s for his country.&nbsp; Thou art sad<br />
At thought of her forlorn and abject state,<br />
From which no power of thine can raise her up.<br />
Thus fancy paints thee, and, though apt to err,<br />
Perhaps errs little when she paints thee thus.<br />
She tells me too that duly every morn<br />
Thou climb&rsquo;st the mountain-top, with eager eye<br />
Exploring far and wide the watery waste,<br />
For sight of ship from England.&nbsp; Every speck<br />
Seen in the dim horizon turns thee pale<br />
With conflict of contending hopes and fears.<br />
But comes at last the dull and dusky eve,<br />
And sends thee to thy cabin, well prepared<br />
To dream all night of what the day denied.<br />
Alas, expect it not.&nbsp; We found no bait<br />
To tempt us in thy country.&nbsp; Doing good,<br />
Disinterested good, is not our trade.<br />
We travel far, &rsquo;tis true, but not for naught;<br />
And must be bribed to compass earth again<br />
By other hopes, and richer fruits than yours.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though true worth and
virtue, in the mild<br />
And genial soil of cultivated life<br />
Thrive most, and may perhaps thrive only there,<br />
Yet not in cities oft.&nbsp; In proud and gay<br />
And gain-devoted cities, thither flow,<br />
As to a common and most noisome sewer,<br />
The dregs and feculence of every land.<br />
In cities, foul example on most minds<br />
Begets its likeness.&nbsp; Rank abundance breeds<br />
In gross and pampered cities sloth and lust,<br />
And wantonness and gluttonous excess.<br />
In cities, vice is hidden with most ease,<br />
Or seen with least reproach; and virtue, taught<br />
By frequent lapse, can hope no triumph there,<br />
Beyond the achievement of successful flight.<br />
I do confess them nurseries of the arts,<br />
In which they flourish most; where, in the beams<br />
Of warm encouragement, and in the eye<br />
Of public note, they reach their perfect size.<br />
Such London is, by taste and wealth proclaimed<br />
The fairest capital in all the world,<br />
By riot and incontinence the worst.<br />
There, touched by Reynolds, a dull blank becomes<br />
A lucid mirror, in which nature sees<br />
All her reflected features.&nbsp; Bacon there<br />
Gives more than female beauty to a stone,<br />
And Chatham&rsquo;s eloquence to marble lips.<br />
Nor does the chisel occupy alone<br />
The powers of sculpture, but the style as much;<br />
Each province of her art her equal care.<br />
With nice incision of her guided steel<br />
She ploughs a brazen field, and clothes a soil<br />
So sterile with what charms soe&rsquo;er she will,<br />
The richest scenery and the loveliest forms.<br />
Where finds philosophy her eagle eye,<br />
With which she gazes at yon burning disk<br />
Undazzled, and detects and counts his spots?<br />
In London.&nbsp; Where her implements exact,<br />
With which she calculates, computes, and scans<br />
All distance, motion, magnitude, and now<br />
Measures an atom, and now girds a world?<br />
In London.&nbsp; Where has commerce such a mart,<br />
So rich, so thronged, so drained, and so supplied,<br />
As London, opulent, enlarged, and still<br />
Increasing London?&nbsp; Babylon of old<br />
Not more the glory of the earth, than she<br />
A more accomplished world&rsquo;s chief glory now.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has her praise.&nbsp; Now
mark a spot or two<br />
That so much beauty would do well to purge;<br />
And show this queen of cities, that so fair<br />
May yet be foul; so witty, yet not wise.<br />
It is not seemly, nor of good report,<br />
That she is slack in discipline; more prompt<br />
To avenge than to prevent the breach of law:<br />
That she is rigid in denouncing death<br />
On petty robbers, and indulges life<br />
And liberty, and ofttimes honour too,<br />
To peculators of the public gold:<br />
That thieves at home must hang; but he, that puts<br />
Into his overgorged and bloated purse<br />
The wealth of Indian provinces, escapes.<br />
Nor is it well, nor can it come to good,<br />
That through profane and infidel contempt<br />
Of holy writ, she has presumed to annul<br />
And abrogate, as roundly as she may,<br />
The total ordinance and will of God;<br />
Advancing fashion to the post of truth,<br />
And centring all authority in modes<br />
And customs of her own, till Sabbath rites<br />
Have dwindled into unrespected forms,<br />
And knees and hassocks are wellnigh divorced.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God made the country, and man
made the town.<br />
What wonder, then, that health and virtue, gifts<br />
That can alone make sweet the bitter draught<br />
That life holds out to all, should most abound<br />
And least be threatened in the fields and groves?<br />
Possess ye therefore, ye who, borne about<br />
In chariots and sedans, know no fatigue<br />
But that of idleness, and taste no scenes<br />
But such as art contrives, possess ye still<br />
Your element; there only ye can shine,<br />
There only minds like yours can do no harm.<br />
Our groves were planted to console at noon<br />
The pensive wanderer in their shades.&nbsp; At eve<br />
The moonbeam, sliding softly in between<br />
The sleeping leaves, is all the light they wish,<br />
Birds warbling all the music.&nbsp; We can spare<br />
The splendour of your lamps, they but eclipse<br />
Our softer satellite.&nbsp; Your songs confound<br />
Our more harmonious notes.&nbsp; The thrush departs<br />
Scared, and the offended nightingale is mute.<br />
There is a public mischief in your mirth;<br />
It plagues your country.&nbsp; Folly such as yours,<br />
Graced with a sword, and worthier of a fan,<br />
Has made, which enemies could ne&rsquo;er have done,<br />
Our arch of empire, steadfast but for you,<br />
A mutilated structure, soon to fall.</p>
<h3>BOOK II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE TIMEPIECE.</span></h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Oh</span> for a lodge in
some vast wilderness,<br />
Some boundless contiguity of shade,<br />
Where rumour of oppression and deceit,<br />
Of unsuccessful or successful war,<br />
Might never reach me more!&nbsp; My ear is pained,<br />
My soul is sick with every day&rsquo;s report<br />
Of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled.<br />
There is no flesh in man&rsquo;s obdurate heart,<br />
It does not feel for man.&nbsp; The natural bond<br />
Of brotherhood is severed as the flax<br />
That falls asunder at the touch of fire.<br />
He finds his fellow guilty of a skin<br />
Not coloured like his own, and having power<br />
To enforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause<br />
Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.<br />
Lands intersected by a narrow frith<br />
Abhor each other.&nbsp; Mountains interposed<br />
Make enemies of nations, who had else<br />
Like kindred drops been mingled into one.<br />
Thus man devotes his brother, and destroys;<br />
And worse than all, and most to be deplored,<br />
As human nature&rsquo;s broadest, foulest blot,<br />
Chains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat<br />
With stripes, that mercy, with a bleeding heart,<br />
Weeps when she sees inflicted on a beast.<br />
Then what is man?&nbsp; And what man, seeing this,<br />
And having human feelings, does not blush<br />
And hang his head, to think himself a man?<br />
I would not have a slave to till my ground,<br />
To carry me, to fan me while I sleep,<br />
And tremble when I wake, for all the wealth<br />
That sinews bought and sold have ever earned.<br />
No: dear as freedom is, and in my heart&rsquo;s<br />
Just estimation prized above all price,<br />
I had much rather be myself the slave<br />
And wear the bonds, than fasten them on him.<br />
We have no slaves at home&mdash;then why abroad?<br />
And they themselves, once ferried o&rsquo;er the wave<br />
That parts us, are emancipate and loosed.<br />
Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs<br />
Receive our air, that moment they are free,<br />
They touch our country and their shackles fall.<br />
That&rsquo;s noble, and bespeaks a nation proud<br />
And jealous of the blessing.&nbsp; Spread it then,<br />
And let it circulate through every vein<br />
Of all your empire; that where Britain&rsquo;s power<br />
Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure there is need of social
intercourse,<br />
Benevolence and peace and mutual aid,<br />
Between the nations, in a world that seems<br />
To toll the death-bell to its own decease;<br />
And by the voice of all its elements<br />
To preach the general doom.&nbsp; When were the winds<br />
Let slip with such a warrant to destroy?<br />
When did the waves so haughtily o&rsquo;erleap<br />
Their ancient barriers, deluging the dry?<br />
Fires from beneath and meteors from above,<br />
Portentous, unexampled, unexplained,<br />
Have kindled beacons in the skies, and the old<br />
And crazy earth has had her shaking fits<br />
More frequent, and foregone her usual rest.<br />
Is it a time to wrangle, when the props<br />
And pillars of our planet seem to fail,<br />
And nature with a dim and sickly eye<br />
To wait the close of all?&nbsp; But grant her end<br />
More distant, and that prophecy demands<br />
A longer respite, unaccomplished yet;<br />
Still they are frowning signals, and bespeak<br />
Displeasure in His breast who smites the earth<br />
Or heals it, makes it languish or rejoice.<br />
And &rsquo;tis but seemly, that, where all deserve<br />
And stand exposed by common peccancy<br />
To what no few have felt, there should be peace,<br />
And brethren in calamity should love.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas for Sicily, rude
fragments now<br />
Lie scattered where the shapely column stood.<br />
Her palaces are dust.&nbsp; In all her streets<br />
The voice of singing and the sprightly chord<br />
Are silent.&nbsp; Revelry and dance and show<br />
Suffer a syncope and solemn pause,<br />
While God performs, upon the trembling stage<br />
Of His own works, His dreadful part alone.<br />
How does the earth receive Him?&mdash;With what signs<br />
Of gratulation and delight, her King?<br />
Pours she not all her choicest fruits abroad,<br />
Her sweetest flowers, her aromatic gums,<br />
Disclosing paradise where&rsquo;er He treads?<br />
She quakes at His approach.&nbsp; Her hollow womb,<br />
Conceiving thunders, through a thousand deeps<br />
And fiery caverns roars beneath His foot.<br />
The hills move lightly and the mountains smoke,<br />
For He has touched them.&nbsp; From the extremest point<br />
Of elevation down into the abyss,<br />
His wrath is busy and His frown is felt.<br />
The rocks fall headlong and the valleys rise,<br />
The rivers die into offensive pools,<br />
And, charged with putrid verdure, breathe a gross<br />
And mortal nuisance into all the air.<br />
What solid was, by transformation strange<br />
Grows fluid, and the fixed and rooted earth<br />
Tormented into billows, heaves and swells,<br />
Or with vortiginous and hideous whirl<br />
Sucks down its prey insatiable.&nbsp; Immense<br />
The tumult and the overthrow, the pangs<br />
And agonies of human and of brute<br />
Multitudes, fugitive on every side,<br />
And fugitive in vain.&nbsp; The sylvan scene<br />
Migrates uplifted, and, with all its soil<br />
Alighting in far-distant fields, finds out<br />
A new possessor, and survives the change.<br />
Ocean has caught the frenzy, and upwrought<br />
To an enormous and o&rsquo;erbearing height,<br />
Not by a mighty wind, but by that voice<br />
Which winds and waves obey, invades the shore<br />
Resistless.&nbsp; Never such a sudden flood,<br />
Upridged so high, and sent on such a charge,<br />
Possessed an inland scene.&nbsp; Where now the throng<br />
That pressed the beach and hasty to depart<br />
Looked to the sea for safety?&nbsp; They are gone,<br />
Gone with the refluent wave into the deep,<br />
A prince with half his people.&nbsp; Ancient towers,<br />
And roofs embattled high, the gloomy scenes<br />
Where beauty oft and lettered worth consume<br />
Life in the unproductive shades of death,<br />
Fall prone: the pale inhabitants come forth,<br />
And, happy in their unforeseen release<br />
From all the rigours of restraint, enjoy<br />
The terrors of the day that sets them free.<br />
Who then, that has thee, would not hold thee fast,<br />
Freedom! whom they that lose thee so regret,<br />
That even a judgment, making way for thee,<br />
Seems in their eyes a mercy, for thy sake.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such evil sin hath wrought;
and such a flame<br />
Kindled in heaven, that it burns down to earth,<br />
And, in the furious inquest that it makes<br />
On God&rsquo;s behalf, lays waste His fairest works.<br />
The very elements, though each be meant<br />
The minister of man to serve his wants,<br />
Conspire against him.&nbsp; With his breath he draws<br />
A plague into his blood; and cannot use<br />
Life&rsquo;s necessary means, but he must die.<br />
Storms rise to o&rsquo;erwhelm him: or, if stormy winds<br />
Rise not, the waters of the deep shall rise,<br />
And, needing none assistance of the storm,<br />
Shall roll themselves ashore, and reach him there.<br />
The earth shall shake him out of all his holds,<br />
Or make his house his grave; nor so content,<br />
Shall counterfeit the motions of the flood,<br />
And drown him in her dry and dusty gulfs.<br />
What then&mdash;were they the wicked above all,<br />
And we the righteous, whose fast-anchored isle<br />
Moved not, while theirs was rocked like a light skiff,<br />
The sport of every wave?&nbsp; No: none are clear,<br />
And none than we more guilty.&nbsp; But where all<br />
Stand chargeable with guilt, and to the shafts<br />
Of wrath obnoxious, God may choose His mark,<br />
May punish, if He please, the less, to warn<br />
The more malignant.&nbsp; If He spared not them,<br />
Tremble and be amazed at thine escape,<br />
Far guiltier England, lest He spare not thee!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy the man who sees a God
employed<br />
In all the good and ill that chequer life!<br />
Resolving all events, with their effects<br />
And manifold results, into the will<br />
And arbitration wise of the Supreme.<br />
Did not His eye rule all things, and intend<br />
The least of our concerns (since from the least<br />
The greatest oft originate), could chance<br />
Find place in His dominion, or dispose<br />
One lawless particle to thwart His plan,<br />
Then God might be surprised, and unforeseen<br />
Contingence might alarm Him, and disturb<br />
The smooth and equal course of His affairs.<br />
This truth, philosophy, though eagle-eyed<br />
In nature&rsquo;s tendencies, oft overlooks;<br />
And, having found His instrument, forgets<br />
Or disregards, or, more presumptuous still,<br />
Denies the power that wields it.&nbsp; God proclaims<br />
His hot displeasure against foolish men<br />
That live an Atheist life: involves the heaven<br />
In tempests, quits His grasp upon the winds<br />
And gives them all their fury; bids a plague<br />
Kindle a fiery boil upon the skin,<br />
And putrefy the breath of blooming health.<br />
He calls for Famine, and the meagre fiend<br />
Blows mildew from between his shrivelled lips,<br />
And taints the golden ear.&nbsp; He springs His mines,<br />
And desolates a nation at a blast.<br />
Forth steps the spruce philosopher, and tells<br />
Of homogeneal and discordant springs<br />
And principles; of causes how they work<br />
By necessary laws their sure effects;<br />
Of action and reaction.&nbsp; He has found<br />
The source of the disease that nature feels,<br />
And bids the world take heart and banish fear.<br />
Thou fool! will thy discovery of the cause<br />
Suspend the effect, or heal it?&nbsp; Has not God<br />
Still wrought by means since first He made the world,<br />
And did He not of old employ His means<br />
To drown it?&nbsp; What is His creation less<br />
Than a capacious reservoir of means<br />
Formed for His use, and ready at His will?<br />
Go, dress thine eyes with eye-salve, ask of Him,<br />
Or ask of whomsoever He has taught,<br />
And learn, though late, the genuine cause of all.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England, with all thy faults,
I love thee still&mdash;<br />
My country! and while yet a nook is left,<br />
Where English minds and manners may be found,<br />
Shall be constrained to love thee.&nbsp; Though thy clime<br />
Be fickle, and thy year most part deformed<br />
With dripping rains, or withered by a frost,<br />
I would not yet exchange thy sullen skies<br />
And fields without a flower, for warmer France<br />
With all her vines; nor for Ausonia&rsquo;s groves<br />
Of golden fruitage, and her myrtle bowers.<br />
To shake thy senate, and from heights sublime<br />
Of patriot eloquence to flash down fire<br />
Upon thy foes, was never meant my task;<br />
But I can feel thy fortune, and partake<br />
Thy joys and sorrows with as true a heart<br />
As any thunderer there.&nbsp; And I can feel<br />
Thy follies too, and with a just disdain<br />
Frown at effeminates, whose very looks<br />
Reflect dishonour on the land I love.<br />
How, in the name of soldiership and sense,<br />
Should England prosper, when such things, as smooth<br />
And tender as a girl, all essenced o&rsquo;er<br />
With odours, and as profligate as sweet,<br />
Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath,<br />
And love when they should fight; when such as these<br />
Presume to lay their hand upon the ark<br />
Of her magnificent and awful cause?<br />
Time was when it was praise and boast enough<br />
In every clime, and travel where we might,<br />
That we were born her children.&nbsp; Praise enough<br />
To fill the ambition of a private man,<br />
That Chatham&rsquo;s language was his mother tongue,<br />
And Wolfe&rsquo;s great name compatriot with his own.<br />
Farewell those honours, and farewell with them<br />
The hope of such hereafter.&nbsp; They have fallen<br />
Each in his field of glory; one in arms,<br />
And one in council;&mdash;Wolfe upon the lap<br />
Of smiling victory that moment won,<br />
And Chatham, heart-sick of his country&rsquo;s shame.<br />
They made us many soldiers.&nbsp; Chatham, still<br />
Consulting England&rsquo;s happiness at home,<br />
Secured it by an unforgiving frown<br />
If any wronged her.&nbsp; Wolfe, where&rsquo;er he fought,<br />
Put so much of his heart into his act,<br />
That his example had a magnet&rsquo;s force,<br />
And all were swift to follow whom all loved.<br />
Those suns are set.&nbsp; Oh, rise some other such!<br />
Or all that we have left is empty talk<br />
Of old achievements, and despair of new.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now hoist the sail, and let
the streamers float<br />
Upon the wanton breezes.&nbsp; Strew the deck<br />
With lavender, and sprinkle liquid sweets,<br />
That no rude savour maritime invade<br />
The nose of nice nobility.&nbsp; Breathe soft,<br />
Ye clarionets, and softer still, ye flutes,<br />
That winds and waters lulled by magic sounds<br />
May bear us smoothly to the Gallic shore.<br />
True, we have lost an empire&mdash;let it pass.<br />
True, we may thank the perfidy of France<br />
That picked the jewel out of England&rsquo;s crown,<br />
With all the cunning of an envious shrew.<br />
And let that pass&mdash;&rsquo;twas but a trick of state.<br />
A brave man knows no malice, but at once<br />
Forgets in peace the injuries of war,<br />
And gives his direst foe a friend&rsquo;s embrace.<br />
And shamed as we have been, to the very beard<br />
Braved and defied, and in our own sea proved<br />
Too weak for those decisive blows that once<br />
Insured us mastery there, we yet retain<br />
Some small pre-eminence, we justly boast<br />
At least superior jockeyship, and claim<br />
The honours of the turf as all our own.<br />
Go then, well worthy of the praise ye seek,<br />
And show the shame ye might conceal at home,<br />
In foreign eyes!&mdash;be grooms, and win the plate,<br />
Where once your nobler fathers won a crown!&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis generous to communicate your skill<br />
To those that need it.&nbsp; Folly is soon learned,<br />
And, under such preceptors, who can fail?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pleasure in poetic
pains<br />
Which only poets know.&nbsp; The shifts and turns,<br />
The expedients and inventions multiform<br />
To which the mind resorts, in chase of terms<br />
Though apt, yet coy, and difficult to win&mdash;<br />
To arrest the fleeting images that fill<br />
The mirror of the mind, and hold them fast,<br />
And force them sit, till he has pencilled off<br />
A faithful likeness of the forms he views;<br />
Then to dispose his copies with such art<br />
That each may find its most propitious light,<br />
And shine by situation, hardly less<br />
Than by the labour and the skill it cost,<br />
Are occupations of the poet&rsquo;s mind<br />
So pleasing, and that steal away the thought<br />
With such address from themes of sad import,<br />
That, lost in his own musings, happy man!<br />
He feels the anxieties of life, denied<br />
Their wonted entertainment, all retire.<br />
Such joys has he that sings.&nbsp; But ah! not such,<br />
Or seldom such, the hearers of his song.<br />
Fastidious, or else listless, or perhaps<br />
Aware of nothing arduous in a task<br />
They never undertook, they little note<br />
His dangers or escapes, and haply find<br />
There least amusement where he found the most.<br />
But is amusement all? studious of song<br />
And yet ambitious not to sing in vain,<br />
I would not trifle merely, though the world<br />
Be loudest in their praise who do no more.<br />
Yet what can satire, whether grave or gay?<br />
It may correct a foible, may chastise<br />
The freaks of fashion, regulate the dress,<br />
Retrench a sword-blade, or displace a patch;<br />
But where are its sublimer trophies found?<br />
What vice has it subdued? whose heart reclaimed<br />
By rigour, or whom laughed into reform?<br />
Alas, Leviathan is not so tamed.<br />
Laughed at, he laughs again; and, stricken hard,<br />
Turns to the stroke his adamantine scales,<br />
That fear no discipline of human hands.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pulpit
therefore&mdash;and I name it, filled<br />
With solemn awe, that bids me well beware<br />
With what intent I touch that holy thing&mdash;<br />
The pulpit, when the satirist has at last,<br />
Strutting and vapouring in an empty school,<br />
Spent all his force, and made no proselyte&mdash;<br />
I say the pulpit, in the sober use<br />
Of its legitimate peculiar powers,<br />
Must stand acknowledged, while the world shall stand,<br />
The most important and effectual guard,<br />
Support, and ornament of virtue&rsquo;s cause.<br />
There stands the messenger of truth; there stands<br />
The legate of the skies; his theme divine,<br />
His office sacred, his credentials clear.<br />
By him, the violated Law speaks out<br />
Its thunders, and by him, in strains as sweet<br />
As angels use, the Gospel whispers peace.<br />
He stablishes the strong, restores the weak,<br />
Reclaims the wanderer, binds the broken heart,<br />
And, armed himself in panoply complete<br />
Of heavenly temper, furnishes with arms<br />
Bright as his own, and trains, by every rule<br />
Of holy discipline, to glorious war,<br />
The sacramental host of God&rsquo;s elect.<br />
Are all such teachers? would to heaven all were!<br />
But hark&mdash;the Doctor&rsquo;s voice&mdash;fast wedged
between<br />
Two empirics he stands, and with swollen cheeks<br />
Inspires the news, his trumpet.&nbsp; Keener far<br />
Than all invective is his bold harangue,<br />
While through that public organ of report<br />
He hails the clergy, and, defying shame,<br />
Announces to the world his own and theirs,<br />
He teaches those to read whom schools dismissed,<br />
And colleges, untaught; sells accents, tone,<br />
And emphasis in score, and gives to prayer<br />
The adagio and andante it demands.<br />
He grinds divinity of other days<br />
Down into modern use; transforms old print<br />
To zigzag manuscript, and cheats the eyes<br />
Of gallery critics by a thousand arts.&mdash;<br />
Are there who purchase of the Doctor&rsquo;s ware?<br />
Oh name it not in Gath!&mdash;it cannot be,<br />
That grave and learned Clerks should need such aid.<br />
He doubtless is in sport, and does but droll,<br />
Assuming thus a rank unknown before,<br />
Grand caterer and dry-nurse of the Church.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I venerate the man whose
heart is warm,<br />
Whose hands are pure, whose doctrine and whose life,<br />
Coincident, exhibit lucid proof<br />
That he is honest in the sacred cause.<br />
To such I render more than mere respect,<br />
Whose actions say that they respect themselves.<br />
But, loose in morals, and in manners vain,<br />
In conversation frivolous, in dress<br />
Extreme, at once rapacious and profuse,<br />
Frequent in park with lady at his side,<br />
Ambling and prattling scandal as he goes,<br />
But rare at home, and never at his books<br />
Or with his pen, save when he scrawls a card;<br />
Constant at routs, familiar with a round<br />
Of ladyships, a stranger to the poor;<br />
Ambitions of preferment for its gold,<br />
And well prepared by ignorance and sloth,<br />
By infidelity and love o&rsquo; the world,<br />
To make God&rsquo;s work a sinecure; a slave<br />
To his own pleasures and his patron&rsquo;s pride.&mdash;<br />
From such apostles, O ye mitred heads,<br />
Preserve the Church! and lay not careless hands<br />
On skulls that cannot teach, and will not learn.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would I describe a preacher,
such as Paul,<br />
Were he on earth, would hear, approve, and own,<br />
Paul should himself direct me.&nbsp; I would trace<br />
His master-strokes, and draw from his design.<br />
I would express him simple, grave, sincere;<br />
In doctrine uncorrupt; in language plain,<br />
And plain in manner; decent, solemn, chaste,<br />
And natural in gesture; much impressed<br />
Himself, as conscious of his awful charge,<br />
And anxious mainly that the flock he feeds<br />
May feel it too; affectionate in look<br />
And tender in address, as well becomes<br />
A messenger of grace to guilty men.<br />
Behold the picture!&mdash;Is it like?&mdash;Like whom?<br />
The things that mount the rostrum with a skip,<br />
And then skip down again; pronounce a text,<br />
Cry&mdash;Hem; and reading what they never wrote,<br />
Just fifteen minutes, huddle up their work,<br />
And with a well-bred whisper close the scene.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In man or woman, but far most
in man,<br />
And most of all in man that ministers<br />
And serves the altar, in my soul I loathe<br />
All affectation.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my perfect scorn;<br />
Object of my implacable disgust.<br />
What!&mdash;will a man play tricks, will he indulge<br />
A silly fond conceit of his fair form<br />
And just proportion, fashionable mien,<br />
And pretty face, in presence of his God?<br />
Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes,<br />
As with the diamond on his lily hand,<br />
And play his brilliant parts before my eyes,<br />
When I am hungry for the Bread of Life?<br />
He mocks his Maker, prostitutes and shames<br />
His noble office, and, instead of truth,<br />
Displaying his own beauty, starves his flock!<br />
Therefore, avaunt, all attitude and stare<br />
And start theatric, practised at the glass.<br />
I seek divine simplicity in him<br />
Who handles things divine; and all beside,<br />
Though learned with labour, and though much admired<br />
By curious eyes and judgments ill-informed,<br />
To me is odious as the nasal twang<br />
Heard at conventicle, where worthy men,<br />
Misled by custom, strain celestial themes<br />
Through the prest nostril, spectacle-bestrid.<br />
Some, decent in demeanour while they preach,<br />
That task performed, relapse into themselves,<br />
And having spoken wisely, at the close<br />
Grow wanton, and give proof to every eye&mdash;<br />
Whoe&rsquo;er was edified themselves were not.<br />
Forth comes the pocket mirror.&nbsp; First we stroke<br />
An eyebrow; next compose a straggling lock;<br />
Then with an air, most gracefully performed,<br />
Fall back into our seat; extend an arm,<br />
And lay it at its ease with gentle care,<br />
With handkerchief in hand, depending low:<br />
The better hand, more busy, gives the nose<br />
Its bergamot, or aids the indebted eye<br />
With opera glass to watch the moving scene,<br />
And recognise the slow-retiring fair.<br />
Now this is fulsome, and offends me more<br />
Than in a Churchman slovenly neglect<br />
And rustic coarseness would.&nbsp; A heavenly mind<br />
May be indifferent to her house of clay,<br />
And slight the hovel as beneath her care.<br />
But how a body so fantastic, trim,<br />
And quaint in its deportment and attire,<br />
Can lodge a heavenly mind&mdash;demands a doubt.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He that negotiates between
God and man,<br />
As God&rsquo;s ambassador, the grand concerns<br />
Of judgment and of mercy, should beware<br />
Of lightness in his speech.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis pitiful<br />
To court a grin, when you should woo a soul;<br />
To break a jest, when pity would inspire<br />
Pathetic exhortation; and to address<br />
The skittish fancy with facetious tales,<br />
When sent with God&rsquo;s commission to the heart.<br />
So did not Paul.&nbsp; Direct me to a quip<br />
Or merry turn in all he ever wrote,<br />
And I consent you take it for your text,<br />
Your only one, till sides and benches fail.<br />
No: he was serious in a serious cause,<br />
And understood too well the weighty terms<br />
That he had ta&rsquo;en in charge.&nbsp; He would not stoop<br />
To conquer those by jocular exploits,<br />
Whom truth and soberness assailed in vain.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, popular applause! what
heart of man<br />
Is proof against thy sweet seducing charms?<br />
The wisest and the best feel urgent need<br />
Of all their caution in thy gentlest gales;<br />
But swelled into a gust&mdash;who then, alas!<br />
With all his canvas set, and inexpert,<br />
And therefore heedless, can withstand thy power?<br />
Praise from the riveled lips of toothless, bald<br />
Decrepitude, and in the looks of lean<br />
And craving poverty, and in the bow<br />
Respectful of the smutched artificer,<br />
Is oft too welcome, and may much disturb<br />
The bias of the purpose.&nbsp; How much more,<br />
Poured forth by beauty splendid and polite,<br />
In language soft as adoration breathes?<br />
Ah, spare your idol! think him human still;<br />
Charms he may have, but he has frailties too;<br />
Dote not too much, nor spoil what ye admire.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All truth is from the
sempiternal source<br />
Of light divine.&nbsp; But Egypt, Greece, and Rome<br />
Drew from the stream below.&nbsp; More favoured, we<br />
Drink, when we choose it, at the fountain head.<br />
To them it flowed much mingled and defiled<br />
With hurtful error, prejudice, and dreams<br />
Illusive of philosophy, so called,<br />
But falsely.&nbsp; Sages after sages strove,<br />
In vain, to filter off a crystal draught<br />
Pure from the lees, which often more enhanced<br />
The thirst than slaked it, and not seldom bred<br />
Intoxication and delirium wild.<br />
In vain they pushed inquiry to the birth<br />
And spring-time of the world; asked, Whence is man?<br />
Why formed at all? and wherefore as he is?<br />
Where must he find his Maker?&nbsp; With what rites<br />
Adore Him?&nbsp; Will He hear, accept, and bless?<br />
Or does He sit regardless of His works?<br />
Has man within him an immortal seed?<br />
Or does the tomb take all?&nbsp; If he survive<br />
His ashes, where? and in what weal or woe?<br />
Knots worthy of solution, which alone<br />
A Deity could solve.&nbsp; Their answers vague,<br />
And all at random, fabulous and dark,<br />
Left them as dark themselves.&nbsp; Their rules of life,<br />
Defective and unsanctioned, proved too weak<br />
To bind the roving appetite, and lead<br />
Blind nature to a God not yet revealed.<br />
&rsquo;Tis Revelation satisfies all doubts,<br />
Explains all mysteries, except her own,<br />
And so illuminates the path of life,<br />
That fools discover it, and stray no more.<br />
Now tell me, dignified and sapient sir,<br />
My man of morals, nurtured in the shades<br />
Of Academus, is this false or true?<br />
Is Christ the abler teacher, or the schools?<br />
If Christ, then why resort at every turn<br />
To Athens or to Rome for wisdom short<br />
Of man&rsquo;s occasions, when in Him reside<br />
Grace, knowledge, comfort, an unfathomed store?<br />
How oft when Paul has served us with a text,<br />
Has Epictetus, Plato, Tully, preached!<br />
Men that, if now alive, would sit content<br />
And humble learners of a Saviour&rsquo;s worth,<br />
Preach it who might.&nbsp; Such was their love of truth,<br />
Their thirst of knowledge, and their candour too.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus it is.&nbsp; The
pastor, either vain<br />
By nature, or by flattery made so, taught<br />
To gaze at his own splendour, and to exalt<br />
Absurdly, not his office, but himself;<br />
Or unenlightened, and too proud to learn,<br />
Or vicious, and not therefore apt to teach,<br />
Perverting often, by the stress of lewd<br />
And loose example, whom he should instruct,<br />
Exposes and holds up to broad disgrace<br />
The noblest function, and discredits much<br />
The brightest truths that man has ever seen.<br />
For ghostly counsel, if it either fall<br />
Below the exigence, or be not backed<br />
With show of love, at least with hopeful proof<br />
Of some sincerity on the giver&rsquo;s part;<br />
Or be dishonoured in the exterior form<br />
And mode of its conveyance, by such tricks<br />
As move derision, or by foppish airs<br />
And histrionic mummery, that let down<br />
The pulpit to the level of the stage;<br />
Drops from the lips a disregarded thing.<br />
The weak perhaps are moved, but are not taught,<br />
While prejudice in men of stronger minds<br />
Takes deeper root, confirmed by what they see.<br />
A relaxation of religion&rsquo;s hold<br />
Upon the roving and untutored heart<br />
Soon follows, and the curb of conscience snapt,<br />
The laity run wild.&mdash;But do they now?<br />
Note their extravagance, and be convinced.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As nations, ignorant of God,
contrive<br />
A wooden one, so we, no longer taught<br />
By monitors that Mother Church supplies,<br />
Now make our own.&nbsp; Posterity will ask<br />
(If e&rsquo;er posterity sees verse of mine),<br />
Some fifty or a hundred lustrums hence,<br />
What was a monitor in George&rsquo;s days?<br />
My very gentle reader, yet unborn,<br />
Of whom I needs must augur better things,<br />
Since Heaven would sure grow weary of a world<br />
Productive only of a race like us,<br />
A monitor is wood&mdash;plank shaven thin.<br />
We wear it at our backs.&nbsp; There, closely braced<br />
And neatly fitted, it compresses hard<br />
The prominent and most unsightly bones,<br />
And binds the shoulders flat.&nbsp; We prove its use<br />
Sovereign and most effectual to secure<br />
A form, not now gymnastic as of yore,<br />
From rickets and distortion, else, our lot.<br />
But thus admonished we can walk erect,<br />
One proof at least of manhood; while the friend<br />
Sticks close, a Mentor worthy of his charge.<br />
Our habits costlier than Lucullus wore,<br />
And, by caprice as multiplied as his,<br />
Just please us while the fashion is at full,<br />
But change with every moon.&nbsp; The sycophant,<br />
That waits to dress us, arbitrates their date,<br />
Surveys his fair reversion with keen eye;<br />
Finds one ill made, another obsolete,<br />
This fits not nicely, that is ill conceived;<br />
And, making prize of all that he condemns,<br />
With our expenditure defrays his own.<br />
Variety&rsquo;s the very spice of life,<br />
That gives it all its flavour.&nbsp; We have run<br />
Through every change that fancy, at the loom<br />
Exhausted, has had genius to supply,<br />
And, studious of mutation still, discard<br />
A real elegance, a little used,<br />
For monstrous novelty and strange disguise.<br />
We sacrifice to dress, till household joys<br />
And comforts cease.&nbsp; Dress drains our cellar dry,<br />
And keeps our larder lean; puts out our fires,<br />
And introduces hunger, frost, and woe,<br />
Where peace and hospitality might reign.<br />
What man that lives, and that knows how to live,<br />
Would fail to exhibit at the public shows<br />
A form as splendid as the proudest there,<br />
Though appetite raise outcries at the cost?<br />
A man o&rsquo; the town dines late, but soon enough,<br />
With reasonable forecast and despatch,<br />
To ensure a side-box station at half-price.<br />
You think, perhaps, so delicate his dress,<br />
His daily fare as delicate.&nbsp; Alas!<br />
He picks clean teeth, and, busy as he seems<br />
With an old tavern quill, is hungry yet.<br />
The rout is folly&rsquo;s circle which she draws<br />
With magic wand.&nbsp; So potent is the spell,<br />
That none decoyed into that fatal ring,<br />
Unless by Heaven&rsquo;s peculiar grace, escape.<br />
There we grow early gray, but never wise;<br />
There form connections, and acquire no friend;<br />
Solicit pleasure hopeless of success;<br />
Waste youth in occupations only fit<br />
For second childhood, and devote old age<br />
To sports which only childhood could excuse.<br />
There they are happiest who dissemble best<br />
Their weariness; and they the most polite,<br />
Who squander time and treasure with a smile,<br />
Though at their own destruction.&nbsp; She that asks<br />
Her dear five hundred friends, contemns them all,<br />
And hates their coming.&nbsp; They (what can they less?)<br />
Make just reprisals, and, with cringe and shrug<br />
And bow obsequious, hide their hate of her.<br />
All catch the frenzy, downward from her Grace,<br />
Whose flambeaux flash against the morning skies,<br />
And gild our chamber ceilings as they pass,<br />
To her who, frugal only that her thrift<br />
May feed excesses she can ill afford,<br />
Is hackneyed home unlackeyed; who, in haste<br />
Alighting, turns the key in her own door,<br />
And, at the watchman&rsquo;s lantern borrowing light,<br />
Finds a cold bed her only comfort left.<br />
Wives beggar husbands, husbands starve their wives,<br />
On Fortune&rsquo;s velvet altar offering up<br />
Their last poor pittance&mdash;Fortune, most severe<br />
Of goddesses yet known, and costlier far<br />
Than all that held their routs in Juno&rsquo;s heaven.&mdash;<br
/>
So fare we in this prison-house the world.<br />
And &rsquo;tis a fearful spectacle to see<br />
So many maniacs dancing in their chains.<br />
They gaze upon the links that hold them fast<br />
With eyes of anguish, execrate their lot,<br />
Then shake them in despair, and dance again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now basket up the family of
plagues<br />
That waste our vitals.&nbsp; Peculation, sale<br />
Of honour, perjury, corruption, frauds<br />
By forgery, by subterfuge of law,<br />
By tricks and lies, as numerous and as keen<br />
As the necessities their authors feel;<br />
Then cast them, closely bundled, every brat<br />
At the right door.&nbsp; Profusion is its sire.<br />
Profusion unrestrained, with all that&rsquo;s base<br />
In character, has littered all the land,<br />
And bred within the memory of no few<br />
A priesthood such as Baal&rsquo;s was of old,<br />
A people such as never was till now.<br />
It is a hungry vice:&mdash;it eats up all<br />
That gives society its beauty, strength,<br />
Convenience, and security, and use;<br />
Makes men mere vermin, worthy to be trapped<br />
And gibbeted, as fast as catchpole claws<br />
Can seize the slippery prey; unties the knot<br />
Of union, and converts the sacred band<br />
That holds mankind together to a scourge.<br />
Profusion, deluging a state with lusts<br />
Of grossest nature and of worst effects,<br />
Prepares it for its ruin; hardens, blinds,<br />
And warps the consciences of public men<br />
Till they can laugh at virtue; mock the fools<br />
That trust them; and, in the end, disclose a face<br />
That would have shocked credulity herself,<br />
Unmasked, vouchsafing this their sole excuse;&mdash;<br />
Since all alike are selfish, why not they?<br />
This does Profusion, and the accursed cause<br />
Of such deep mischief has itself a cause.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In colleges and halls, in
ancient days,<br />
When learning, virtue, piety, and truth<br />
Were precious, and inculcated with care,<br />
There dwelt a sage called Discipline.&nbsp; His head,<br />
Not yet by time completely silvered o&rsquo;er,<br />
Bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth,<br />
But strong for service still, and unimpaired.<br />
His eye was meek and gentle, and a smile<br />
Played on his lips, and in his speech was heard<br />
Paternal sweetness, dignity, and love.<br />
The occupation dearest to his heart<br />
Was to encourage goodness.&nbsp; He would stroke<br />
The head of modest and ingenuous worth,<br />
That blushed at its own praise, and press the youth<br />
Close to his side that pleased him.&nbsp; Learning grew<br />
Beneath his care, a thriving, vigorous plant;<br />
The mind was well informed, the passions held<br />
Subordinate, and diligence was choice.<br />
If e&rsquo;er it chanced, as sometimes chance it must,<br />
That one among so many overleaped<br />
The limits of control, his gentle eye<br />
Grew stern, and darted a severe rebuke;<br />
His frown was full of terror, and his voice<br />
Shook the delinquent with such fits of awe<br />
As left him not, till penitence had won<br />
Lost favour back again, and closed the breach.<br />
But Discipline, a faithful servant long,<br />
Declined at length into the vale of years;<br />
A palsy struck his arm, his sparkling eye<br />
Was quenched in rheums of age, his voice unstrung<br />
Grew tremulous, and moved derision more<br />
Than reverence in perverse, rebellious youth.<br />
So colleges and halls neglected much<br />
Their good old friend, and Discipline at length,<br />
O&rsquo;erlooked and unemployed, fell sick and died.<br />
Then study languished, emulation slept,<br />
And virtue fled.&nbsp; The schools became a scene<br />
Of solemn farce, where ignorance in stilts,<br />
His cap well lined with logic not his own,<br />
With parrot tongue performed the scholar&rsquo;s part,<br />
Proceeding soon a graduated dunce.<br />
Then compromise had place, and scrutiny<br />
Became stone-blind, precedence went in truck,<br />
And he was competent whose purse was so.<br />
A dissolution of all bonds ensued,<br />
The curbs invented for the mulish mouth<br />
Of headstrong youth were broken; bars and bolts<br />
Grew rusty by disuse, and massy gates<br />
Forgot their office, opening with a touch;<br />
Till gowns at length are found mere masquerade;<br />
The tasselled cap and the spruce band a jest,<br />
A mockery of the world.&nbsp; What need of these<br />
For gamesters, jockeys, brothellers impure,<br />
Spendthrifts and booted sportsmen, oftener seen<br />
With belted waist, and pointers at their heels,<br />
Than in the bounds of duty?&nbsp; What was learned,<br />
If aught was learned in childhood, is forgot,<br />
And such expense as pinches parents blue<br />
And mortifies the liberal hand of love,<br />
Is squandered in pursuit of idle sports<br />
And vicious pleasures; buys the boy a name,<br />
That sits a stigma on his father&rsquo;s house,<br />
And cleaves through life inseparably close<br />
To him that wears it.&nbsp; What can after-games<br />
Of riper joys, and commerce with the world,<br />
The lewd vain world that must receive him soon,<br />
Add to such erudition thus acquired,<br />
Where science and where virtue are professed?<br />
They may confirm his habits, rivet fast<br />
His folly, but to spoil him is a task<br />
That bids defiance to the united powers<br />
Of fashion, dissipation, taverns, stews.<br />
Now, blame we most the nurselings, or the nurse?<br />
The children crooked and twisted and deformed<br />
Through want of care, or her whose winking eye<br />
And slumbering oscitancy mars the brood?<br />
The nurse no doubt.&nbsp; Regardless of her charge,<br />
She needs herself correction; needs to learn<br />
That it is dangerous sporting with the world,<br />
With things so sacred as a nation&rsquo;s trust;<br />
The nurture of her youth, her dearest pledge.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are not such.&nbsp; I had
a brother once&mdash;<br />
Peace to the memory of a man of worth,<br />
A man of letters and of manners too&mdash;<br />
Of manners sweet as virtue always wears,<br />
When gay good-nature dresses her in smiles.<br />
He graced a college in which order yet<br />
Was sacred, and was honoured, loved, and wept,<br />
By more than one, themselves conspicuous there.<br />
Some minds are tempered happily, and mixt<br />
With such ingredients of good sense and taste<br />
Of what is excellent in man, they thirst<br />
With such a zeal to be what they approve,<br />
That no restraints can circumscribe them more<br />
Than they themselves by choice, for wisdom&rsquo;s sake.<br />
Nor can example hurt them.&nbsp; What they see<br />
Of vice in others but enhancing more<br />
The charms of virtue in their just esteem.<br />
If such escape contagion, and emerge<br />
Pure, from so foul a pool, to shine abroad,<br />
And give the world their talents and themselves,<br />
Small thanks to those whose negligence or sloth<br />
Exposed their inexperience to the snare,<br />
And left them to an undirected choice.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, then, the quiver broken
and decayed,<br />
In which are kept our arrows.&nbsp; Rusting there<br />
In wild disorder and unfit for use,<br />
What wonder if discharged into the world<br />
They shame their shooters with a random flight,<br />
Their points obtuse and feathers drunk with wine.<br />
Well may the Church wage unsuccessful war<br />
With such artillery armed.&nbsp; Vice parries wide<br />
The undreaded volley with a sword of straw,<br />
And stands an impudent and fearless mark.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we not tracked the felon
home, and found<br />
His birthplace and his dam?&nbsp; The country mourns&mdash;<br />
Mourns, because every plague that can infest<br />
Society, that saps and worms the base<br />
Of the edifice that Policy has raised,<br />
Swarms in all quarters; meets the eye, the ear,<br />
And suffocates the breath at every turn.<br />
Profusion breeds them.&nbsp; And the cause itself<br />
Of that calamitous mischief has been found,<br />
Found, too, where most offensive, in the skirts<br />
Of the robed pedagogue.&nbsp; Else, let the arraigned<br />
Stand up unconscious and refute the charge.<br />
So, when the Jewish leader stretched his arm<br />
And waved his rod divine, a race obscene,<br />
Spawned in the muddy beds of Nile, came forth<br />
Polluting Egypt.&nbsp; Gardens, fields, and plains<br />
Were covered with the pest.&nbsp; The streets were filled;<br />
The croaking nuisance lurked in every nook,<br />
Nor palaces nor even chambers &rsquo;scaped,<br />
And the land stank, so numerous was the fry.</p>
<h3>BOOK III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE GARDEN.</span></h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">As</span> one who, long in
thickets and in brakes<br />
Entangled, winds now this way and now that<br />
His devious course uncertain, seeking home;<br />
Or, having long in miry ways been foiled<br />
And sore discomfited, from slough to slough<br />
Plunging, and half despairing of escape,<br />
If chance at length he find a greensward smooth<br />
And faithful to the foot, his spirits rise,<br />
He chirrups brisk his ear-erecting steed,<br />
And winds his way with pleasure and with ease;<br />
So I, designing other themes, and called<br />
To adorn the Sofa with eulogium due,<br />
To tell its slumbers and to paint its dreams,<br />
Have rambled wide.&nbsp; In country, city, seat<br />
Of academic fame, howe&rsquo;er deserved,<br />
Long held, and scarcely disengaged at last.<br />
But now with pleasant pace, a cleanlier road<br />
I mean to tread.&nbsp; I feel myself at large,<br />
Courageous, and refreshed for future toil,<br />
If toil await me, or if dangers new.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since pulpits fail, and
sounding-boards reflect<br />
Most part an empty ineffectual sound,<br />
What chance that I, to fame so little known,<br />
Nor conversant with men or manners much,<br />
Should speak to purpose, or with better hope<br />
Crack the satiric thong?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twere wiser far<br />
For me, enamoured of sequestered scenes,<br />
And charmed with rural beauty, to repose,<br />
Where chance may throw me, beneath elm or vine<br />
My languid limbs, when summer sears the plains;<br />
Or when rough winter rages, on the soft<br />
And sheltered Sofa, while the nitrous air<br />
Feeds a blue flame and makes a cheerful hearth;<br />
There, undisturbed by folly, and apprised<br />
How great the danger of disturbing her,<br />
To muse in silence, or at least confine<br />
Remarks that gall so many to the few,<br />
My partners in retreat.&nbsp; Disgust concealed<br />
Is ofttimes proof of wisdom, when the fault<br />
Is obstinate, and cure beyond our reach.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic happiness, thou only
bliss<br />
Of Paradise that has survived the fall!<br />
Though few now taste thee unimpaired and pure,<br />
Or, tasting, long enjoy thee, too infirm<br />
Or too incautious to preserve thy sweets<br />
Unmixed with drops of bitter, which neglect<br />
Or temper sheds into thy crystal cup.<br />
Thou art the nurse of virtue.&nbsp; In thine arms<br />
She smiles, appearing, as in truth she is,<br />
Heaven-born, and destined to the skies again.<br />
Thou art not known where Pleasure is adored,<br />
That reeling goddess with the zoneless waist<br />
And wandering eyes, still leaning on the arm<br />
Of Novelty, her fickle frail support;<br />
For thou art meek and constant, hating change,<br />
And finding in the calm of truth-tried love<br />
Joys that her stormy raptures never yield.<br />
Forsaking thee, what shipwreck have we made<br />
Of honour, dignity, and fair renown,<br />
Till prostitution elbows us aside<br />
In all our crowded streets, and senates seem<br />
Convened for purposes of empire less,<br />
Than to release the adult&rsquo;ress from her bond.<br />
The adult&rsquo;ress! what a theme for angry verse,<br />
What provocation to the indignant heart<br />
That feels for injured love! but I disdain<br />
The nauseous task to paint her as she is,<br />
Cruel, abandoned, glorying in her shame.<br />
No; let her pass, and charioted along<br />
In guilty splendour shake the public ways;<br />
The frequency of crimes has washed them white,<br />
And verse of mine shall never brand the wretch<br />
Whom matrons now of character unsmirched<br />
And chaste themselves, are not ashamed to own.<br />
Virtue and vice had boundaries in old time<br />
Not to be passed; and she that had renounced<br />
Her sex&rsquo;s honour, was renounced herself<br />
By all that prized it; not for prudery&rsquo;s sake,<br />
But dignity&rsquo;s, resentful of the wrong.<br />
&rsquo;Twas hard, perhaps, on here and there a waif<br />
Desirous to return, and not received;<br />
But was a wholesome rigour in the main,<br />
And taught the unblemished to preserve with care<br />
That purity, whose loss was loss of all.<br />
Men, too, were nice in honour in those days,<br />
And judged offenders well.&nbsp; Then he that sharped,<br />
And pocketed a prize by fraud obtained,<br />
Was marked and shunned as odious.&nbsp; He that sold<br />
His country, or was slack when she required<br />
His every nerve in action and at stretch,<br />
Paid with the blood that he had basely spared<br />
The price of his default.&nbsp; But now,&mdash;yes, now,<br />
We are become so candid and so fair,<br />
So liberal in construction, and so rich<br />
In Christian charity (good-natured age!)<br />
That they are safe, sinners of either sex,<br />
Transgress what laws they may.&nbsp; Well dressed, well bred,<br
/>
Well equipaged, is ticket good enough<br />
To pass us readily through every door.<br />
Hypocrisy, detest her as we may<br />
(And no man&rsquo;s hatred ever wronged her yet),<br />
May claim this merit still&mdash;that she admits<br />
The worth of what she mimics with such care,<br />
And thus gives virtue indirect applause;<br />
But she has burnt her mask, not needed here,<br />
Where vice has such allowance, that her shifts<br />
And specious semblances have lost their use.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a stricken deer that
left the herd<br />
Long since; with many an arrow deep infixt<br />
My panting side was charged, when I withdrew<br />
To seek a tranquil death in distant shades.<br />
There was I found by one who had himself<br />
Been hurt by the archers.&nbsp; In his side he bore,<br />
And in his hands and feet, the cruel scars.<br />
With gentle force soliciting the darts<br />
He drew them forth, and healed and bade me live.<br />
Since then, with few associates, in remote<br />
And silent woods I wander, far from those<br />
My former partners of the peopled scene,<br />
With few associates, and not wishing more.<br />
Here much I ruminate, as much I may,<br />
With other views of men and manners now<br />
Than once, and others of a life to come.<br />
I see that all are wanderers, gone astray<br />
Each in his own delusions; they are lost<br />
In chase of fancied happiness, still woo&rsquo;d<br />
And never won.&nbsp; Dream after dream ensues,<br />
And still they dream that they shall still succeed,<br />
And still are disappointed: rings the world<br />
With the vain stir.&nbsp; I sum up half mankind,<br />
And add two-thirds of the remaining half,<br />
And find the total of their hopes and fears<br />
Dreams, empty dreams.&nbsp; The million flit as gay<br />
As if created only, like the fly<br />
That spreads his motley wings in the eye of noon,<br />
To sport their season and be seen no more.<br />
The rest are sober dreamers, grave and wise,<br />
And pregnant with discoveries new and rare.<br />
Some write a narrative of wars, and feats<br />
Of heroes little known, and call the rant<br />
A history; describe the man, of whom<br />
His own coevals took but little note,<br />
And paint his person, character, and views,<br />
As they had known him from his mother&rsquo;s womb;<br />
They disentangle from the puzzled skein,<br />
In which obscurity has wrapped them up,<br />
The threads of politic and shrewd design<br />
That ran through all his purposes, and charge<br />
His mind with meanings that he never had,<br />
Or, having, kept concealed.&nbsp; Some drill and bore<br />
The solid earth, and from the strata there<br />
Extract a register, by which we learn<br />
That He who made it and revealed its date<br />
To Moses, was mistaken in its age.<br />
Some, more acute and more industrious still,<br />
Contrive creation; travel nature up<br />
To the sharp peak of her sublimest height,<br />
And tell us whence the stars; why some are fixt,<br />
And planetary some; what gave them first<br />
Rotation, from what fountain flowed their light.<br />
Great contest follows, and much learned dust<br />
Involves the combatants, each claiming truth,<br />
And truth disclaiming both.&nbsp; And thus they spend<br />
The little wick of life&rsquo;s poor shallow lamp<br />
In playing tricks with nature, giving laws<br />
To distant worlds, and trifling in their own.<br />
Is&rsquo;t not a pity now, that tickling rheums<br />
Should ever tease the lungs and blear the sight<br />
Of oracles like these?&nbsp; Great pity, too,<br />
That having wielded the elements, and built<br />
A thousand systems, each in his own way,<br />
They should go out in fume and be forgot?<br />
Ah, what is life thus spent? and what are they<br />
But frantic who thus spend it? all for smoke&mdash;<br />
Eternity for bubbles proves at last<br />
A senseless bargain.&nbsp; When I see such games<br />
Played by the creatures of a Power who swears<br />
That He will judge the earth, and call the fool<br />
To a sharp reckoning that has lived in vain,<br />
And when I weigh this seeming wisdom well,<br />
And prove it in the infallible result<br />
So hollow and so false&mdash;I feel my heart<br />
Dissolve in pity, and account the learned,<br />
If this be learning, most of all deceived.<br />
Great crimes alarm the conscience, but it sleeps<br />
While thoughtful man is plausibly amused.<br />
Defend me, therefore, common sense, say I,<br />
From reveries so airy, from the toil<br />
Of dropping buckets into empty wells,<br />
And growing old in drawing nothing up!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twere well, says one
sage erudite, profound,<br />
Terribly arched and aquiline his nose,<br />
And overbuilt with most impending brows,<br />
&rsquo;Twere well could you permit the world to live<br />
As the world pleases.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the world to
you?&mdash;<br />
Much.&nbsp; I was born of woman, and drew milk<br />
As sweet as charity from human breasts.<br />
I think, articulate, I laugh and weep,<br />
And exercise all functions of a man.<br />
How then should I and any man that lives<br />
Be strangers to each other?&nbsp; Pierce my vein,<br />
Take of the crimson stream meandering there,<br />
And catechise it well.&nbsp; Apply your glass,<br />
Search it, and prove now if it be not blood<br />
Congenial with thine own; and if it be,<br />
What edge of subtlety canst thou suppose<br />
Keen enough, wise and skilful as thou art,<br />
To cut the link of brotherhood, by which<br />
One common Maker bound me to the kind?<br />
True; I am no proficient, I confess,<br />
In arts like yours.&nbsp; I cannot call the swift<br />
And perilous lightnings from the angry clouds,<br />
And bid them hide themselves in the earth beneath;<br />
I cannot analyse the air, nor catch<br />
The parallax of yonder luminous point<br />
That seems half quenched in the immense abyss:<br />
Such powers I boast not&mdash;neither can I rest<br />
A silent witness of the headlong rage,<br />
Or heedless folly, by which thousands die,<br />
Bone of my bone, and kindred souls to mine.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God never meant that man
should scale the heavens<br />
By strides of human wisdom.&nbsp; In His works,<br />
Though wondrous, He commands us in His Word<br />
To seek Him rather where His mercy shines.<br />
The mind indeed, enlightened from above,<br />
Views Him in all; ascribes to the grand cause<br />
The grand effect; acknowledges with joy<br />
His manner, and with rapture tastes His style.<br />
But never yet did philosophic tube,<br />
That brings the planets home into the eye<br />
Of observation, and discovers, else<br />
Not visible, His family of worlds,<br />
Discover Him that rules them; such a veil<br />
Hangs over mortal eyes, blind from the birth,<br />
And dark in things divine.&nbsp; Full often too<br />
Our wayward intellect, the more we learn<br />
Of nature, overlooks her Author more;<br />
From instrumental causes proud to draw<br />
Conclusions retrograde, and mad mistake:<br />
But if His Word once teach us, shoot a ray<br />
Through all the heart&rsquo;s dark chambers, and reveal<br />
Truths undiscerned but by that holy light,<br />
Then all is plain.&nbsp; Philosophy, baptised<br />
In the pure fountain of eternal love,<br />
Has eyes indeed; and, viewing all she sees<br />
As meant to indicate a God to man,<br />
Gives <i>Him</i> His praise, and forfeits not her own.<br />
Learning has borne such fruit in other days<br />
On all her branches.&nbsp; Piety has found<br />
Friends in the friends of science, and true prayer<br />
Has flowed from lips wet with Castalian dews.<br />
Such was thy wisdom, Newton, childlike sage!<br />
Sagacious reader of the works of God,<br />
And in His Word sagacious.&nbsp; Such too thine,<br />
Milton, whose genius had angelic wings,<br />
And fed on manna.&nbsp; And such thine, in whom<br />
Our British Themis gloried with just cause,<br />
Immortal Hale! for deep discernment praised,<br />
And sound integrity not more, than famed<br />
For sanctity of manners undefiled.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All flesh is grass, and all
its glory fades<br />
Like the fair flower dishevelled in the wind;<br />
Riches have wings, and grandeur is a dream;<br />
The man we celebrate must find a tomb,<br />
And we that worship him, ignoble graves.<br />
Nothing is proof against the general curse<br />
Of vanity, that seizes all below.<br />
The only amaranthine flower on earth<br />
Is virtue; the only lasting treasure, truth.<br />
But what is truth? &rsquo;twas Pilate&rsquo;s question put<br />
To truth itself, that deigned him no reply.<br />
And wherefore? will not God impart His light<br />
To them that ask it?&mdash;Freely&mdash;&rsquo;tis His joy,<br />
His glory, and His nature to impart.<br />
But to the proud, uncandid, insincere,<br />
Or negligent inquirer, not a spark.<br />
What&rsquo;s that which brings contempt upon a book<br />
And him that writes it, though the style be neat,<br />
The method clear, and argument exact?<br />
That makes a minister in holy things<br />
The joy of many, and the dread of more,<br />
His name a theme for praise and for reproach?&mdash;<br />
That, while it gives us worth in God&rsquo;s account,<br />
Depreciates and undoes us in our own?<br />
What pearl is it that rich men cannot buy,<br />
That learning is too proud to gather up,<br />
But which the poor and the despised of all<br />
Seek and obtain, and often find unsought?<br />
Tell me, and I will tell thee what is truth.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, friendly to the best
pursuits of man,<br />
Friendly to thought, to virtue, and to peace,<br />
Domestic life in rural leisure passed!<br />
Few know thy value, and few taste thy sweets,<br />
Though many boast thy favours, and affect<br />
To understand and choose thee for their own.<br />
But foolish man foregoes his proper bliss,<br />
Even as his first progenitor, and quits,<br />
Though placed in paradise, for earth has still<br />
Some traces of her youthful beauty left,<br />
Substantial happiness for transient joy.<br />
Scenes formed for contemplation, and to nurse<br />
The growing seeds of wisdom; that suggest,<br />
By every pleasing image they present,<br />
Reflections such as meliorate the heart,<br />
Compose the passions, and exalt the mind;<br />
Scenes such as these, &rsquo;tis his supreme delight<br />
To fill with riot and defile with blood.<br />
Should some contagion, kind to the poor brutes<br />
We persecute, annihilate the tribes<br />
That draw the sportsman over hill and dale<br />
Fearless, and rapt away from all his cares;<br />
Should never game-fowl hatch her eggs again,<br />
Nor baited hook deceive the fish&rsquo;s eye;<br />
Could pageantry, and dance, and feast, and song<br />
Be quelled in all our summer months&rsquo; retreats;<br />
How many self-deluded nymphs and swains,<br />
Who dream they have a taste for fields and groves,<br />
Would find them hideous nurseries of the spleen,<br />
And crowd the roads, impatient for the town!<br />
They love the country, and none else, who seek<br />
For their own sake its silence and its shade;<br />
Delights which who would leave, that has a heart<br />
Susceptible of pity, or a mind<br />
Cultured and capable of sober thought,<br />
For all the savage din of the swift pack,<br />
And clamours of the field?&nbsp; Detested sport,<br />
That owes its pleasures to another&rsquo;s pain,<br />
That feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks<br />
Of harmless nature, dumb, but yet endued<br />
With eloquence, that agonies inspire,<br />
Of silent tears and heart-distending sighs!<br />
Vain tears, alas! and sighs that never find<br />
A corresponding tone in jovial souls.<br />
Well&mdash;one at least is safe.&nbsp; One sheltered hare<br />
Has never heard the sanguinary yell<br />
Of cruel man, exulting in her woes.<br />
Innocent partner of my peaceful home,<br />
Whom ten long years&rsquo; experience of my care<br />
Has made at last familiar, she has lost<br />
Much of her vigilant instinctive dread,<br />
Not needful here, beneath a roof like mine.<br />
Yes&mdash;thou mayst eat thy bread, and lick the hand<br />
That feeds thee; thou mayst frolic on the floor<br />
At evening, and at night retire secure<br />
To thy straw-couch, and slumber unalarmed;<br />
For I have gained thy confidence, have pledged<br />
All that is human in me to protect<br />
Thine unsuspecting gratitude and love.<br />
If I survive thee I will dig thy grave,<br />
And when I place thee in it, sighing say,<br />
I knew at least one hare that had a friend.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How various his employments,
whom the world<br />
Calls idle, and who justly in return<br />
Esteems that busy world an idler, too!<br />
Friends, books, a garden, and perhaps his pen,<br />
Delightful industry enjoyed at home,<br />
And nature in her cultivated trim<br />
Dressed to his taste, inviting him abroad&mdash;<br />
Can he want occupation who has these?<br />
Will he be idle who has much to enjoy?<br />
Me, therefore, studious of laborious ease,<br />
Not slothful; happy to deceive the time,<br />
Not waste it; and aware that human life<br />
Is but a loan to be repaid with use,<br />
When He shall call His debtors to account,<br />
From whom are all our blessings; business finds<br />
Even here: while sedulous I seek to improve,<br />
At least neglect not, or leave unemployed,<br />
The mind He gave me; driving it, though slack<br />
Too oft, and much impeded in its work<br />
By causes not to be divulged in vain,<br />
To its just point&mdash;the service of mankind.<br />
He that attends to his interior self,<br />
That has a heart and keeps it; has a mind<br />
That hungers and supplies it; and who seeks<br />
A social, not a dissipated life,<br />
Has business; feels himself engaged to achieve<br />
No unimportant, though a silent task.<br />
A life all turbulence and noise may seem,<br />
To him that leads it, wise and to be praised;<br />
But wisdom is a pearl with most success<br />
Sought in still water, and beneath clear skies.<br />
He that is ever occupied in storms,<br />
Or dives not for it or brings up instead,<br />
Vainly industrious, a disgraceful prize.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning finds the
self-sequestered man<br />
Fresh for his task, intend what task he may.<br />
Whether inclement seasons recommend<br />
His warm but simple home, where he enjoys,<br />
With her who shares his pleasures and his heart,<br />
Sweet converse, sipping calm the fragrant lymph<br />
Which neatly she prepares; then to his book<br />
Well chosen, and not sullenly perused<br />
In selfish silence, but imparted oft<br />
As aught occurs that she may smile to hear,<br />
Or turn to nourishment digested well.<br />
Or if the garden with its many cares,<br />
All well repaid, demand him, he attends<br />
The welcome call, conscious how much the hand<br />
Of lubbard labour needs his watchful eye,<br />
Oft loitering lazily if not o&rsquo;erseen,<br />
Or misapplying his unskilful strength.<br />
Nor does he govern only or direct,<br />
But much performs himself; no works indeed<br />
That ask robust tough sinews, bred to toil,<br />
Servile employ&mdash;but such as may amuse,<br />
Not tire, demanding rather skill than force.<br />
Proud of his well-spread walls, he views his trees<br />
That meet, no barren interval between,<br />
With pleasure more than even their fruits afford,<br />
Which, save himself who trains them, none can feel.<br />
These, therefore, are his own peculiar charge,<br />
No meaner hand may discipline the shoots,<br />
None but his steel approach them.&nbsp; What is weak,<br />
Distempered, or has lost prolific powers,<br />
Impaired by age, his unrelenting hand<br />
Dooms to the knife.&nbsp; Nor does he spare the soft<br />
And succulent that feeds its giant growth,<br />
But barren, at the expense of neighbouring twigs<br />
Less ostentatious, and yet studded thick<br />
With hopeful gems.&nbsp; The rest, no portion left<br />
That may disgrace his art, or disappoint<br />
Large expectation, he disposes neat<br />
At measured distances, that air and sun<br />
Admitted freely may afford their aid,<br />
And ventilate and warm the swelling buds.<br />
Hence Summer has her riches, Autumn hence,<br />
And hence even Winter fills his withered hand<br />
With blushing fruits, and plenty not his own,<br />
Fair recompense of labour well bestowed<br />
And wise precaution, which a clime so rude<br />
Makes needful still, whose Spring is but the child<br />
Of churlish Winter, in her froward moods<br />
Discovering much the temper of her sire.<br />
For oft, as if in her the stream of mild<br />
Maternal nature had reversed its course,<br />
She brings her infants forth with many smiles,<br />
But, once delivered, kills them with a frown.<br />
He therefore, timely warned, himself supplies<br />
Her want of care, screening and keeping warm<br />
The plenteous bloom, that no rough blast may sweep<br />
His garlands from the boughs.&nbsp; Again, as oft<br />
As the sun peeps and vernal airs breathe mild,<br />
The fence withdrawn, he gives them ev&rsquo;ry beam,<br />
And spreads his hopes before the blaze of day.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise the prickly and
green-coated gourd,<br />
So grateful to the palate, and when rare<br />
So coveted, else base and disesteemed&mdash;<br />
Food for the vulgar merely&mdash;is an art<br />
That toiling ages have but just matured,<br />
And at this moment unessayed in song.<br />
Yet gnats have had, and frogs and mice long since,<br />
Their eulogy; those sang the Mantuan bard,<br />
And these the Grecian in ennobling strains;<br />
And in thy numbers, Philips, shines for aye<br />
The solitary Shilling.&nbsp; Pardon then,<br />
Ye sage dispensers of poetic fame!<br />
The ambition of one meaner far, whose powers<br />
Presuming an attempt not less sublime,<br />
Pant for the praise of dressing to the taste<br />
Of critic appetite, no sordid fare,<br />
A cucumber, while costly yet and scarce.</p>
<p class="poetry">The stable yields a stercoraceous heap<br />
Impregnated with quick fermenting salts,<br />
And potent to resist the freezing blast.<br />
For ere the beech and elm have cast their leaf<br />
Deciduous, and when now November dark<br />
Checks vegetation in the torpid plant<br />
Exposed to his cold breath, the task begins.<br />
Warily therefore, and with prudent heed<br />
He seeks a favoured spot, that where he builds<br />
The agglomerated pile, his frame may front<br />
The sun&rsquo;s meridian disk, and at the back<br />
Enjoy close shelter, wall, or reeds, or hedge<br />
Impervious to the wind.&nbsp; First he bids spread<br />
Dry fern or littered hay, that may imbibe<br />
The ascending damps; then leisurely impose,<br />
And lightly, shaking it with agile hand<br />
From the full fork, the saturated straw.<br />
What longest binds the closest, forms secure<br />
The shapely side, that as it rises takes<br />
By just degrees an overhanging breadth,<br />
Sheltering the base with its projected eaves.<br />
The uplifted frame compact at every joint,<br />
And overlaid with clear translucent glass,<br />
He settles next upon the sloping mount,<br />
Whose sharp declivity shoots off secure<br />
From the dashed pane the deluge as it falls.<br />
He shuts it close, and the first labour ends.<br />
Thrice must the voluble and restless earth<br />
Spin round upon her axle, ere the warmth<br />
Slow gathering in the midst, through the square mass<br />
Diffused, attain the surface.&nbsp; When, behold!<br />
A pestilent and most corrosive steam,<br />
Like a gross fog Boeotian, rising fast,<br />
And fast condensed upon the dewy sash,<br />
Asks egress; which obtained, the overcharged<br />
And drenched conservatory breathes abroad,<br />
In volumes wheeling slow, the vapour dank,<br />
And purified, rejoices to have lost<br />
Its foul inhabitant.&nbsp; But to assuage<br />
The impatient fervour which it first conceives<br />
Within its reeking bosom, threatening death<br />
To his young hopes, requires discreet delay.<br />
Experience, slow preceptress, teaching oft<br />
The way to glory by miscarriage foul,<br />
Must prompt him, and admonish how to catch<br />
The auspicious moment, when the tempered heat,<br />
Friendly to vital motion, may afford<br />
Soft fermentation, and invite the seed.<br />
The seed selected wisely, plump and smooth<br />
And glossy, he commits to pots of size<br />
Diminutive, well filled with well-prepared<br />
And fruitful soil, that has been treasured long,<br />
And drunk no moisture from the dripping clouds:<br />
These on the warm and genial earth that hides<br />
The smoking manure, and o&rsquo;erspreads it all,<br />
He places lightly, and, as time subdues<br />
The rage of fermentation, plunges deep<br />
In the soft medium, till they stand immersed.<br />
Then rise the tender germs upstarting quick<br />
And spreading wide their spongy lobes; at first<br />
Pale, wan, and livid; but assuming soon,<br />
If fanned by balmy and nutritious air<br />
Strained through the friendly mats, a vivid green.<br />
Two leaves produced, two rough indented leaves,<br />
Cautious he pinches from the second stalk<br />
A pimple, that portends a future sprout,<br />
And interdicts its growth.&nbsp; Thence straight succeed<br />
The branches, sturdy to his utmost wish,<br />
Prolific all, and harbingers of more.<br />
The crowded roots demand enlargement now<br />
And transplantation in an ampler space.<br />
Indulged in what they wish, they soon supply<br />
Large foliage, overshadowing golden flowers,<br />
Blown on the summit of the apparent fruit.<br />
These have their sexes, and when summer shines<br />
The bee transports the fertilising meal<br />
From flower to flower, and even the breathing air<br />
Wafts the rich prize to its appointed use.<br />
Not so when winter scowls.&nbsp; Assistant art<br />
Then acts in nature&rsquo;s office, brings to pass<br />
The glad espousals and insures the crop.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grudge not, ye rich (since
luxury must have<br />
His dainties, and the world&rsquo;s more numerous half<br />
Lives by contriving delicates for you),<br />
Grudge not the cost.&nbsp; Ye little know the cares,<br />
The vigilance, the labour, and the skill<br />
That day and night are exercised, and hang<br />
Upon the ticklish balance of suspense,<br />
That ye may garnish your profuse regales<br />
With summer fruits, brought forth by wintry suns.<br />
Ten thousand dangers lie in wait to thwart<br />
The process.&nbsp; Heat and cold, and wind and steam,<br />
Moisture and drought, mice, worms, and swarming flies<br />
Minute as dust and numberless, oft work<br />
Dire disappointment that admits no cure,<br />
And which no care can obviate.&nbsp; It were long,<br />
Too long to tell the expedients and the shifts<br />
Which he, that fights a season so severe,<br />
Devises, while he guards his tender trust,<br />
And oft, at last, in vain.&nbsp; The learned and wise<br />
Sarcastic would exclaim, and judge the song<br />
Cold as its theme, and, like its theme, the fruit<br />
Of too much labour, worthless when produced.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loves a garden, loves a
greenhouse too.<br />
Unconscious of a less propitious clime<br />
There blooms exotic beauty, warm and snug,<br />
While the winds whistle and the snows descend.<br />
The spiry myrtle with unwithering leaf<br />
Shines there and flourishes.&nbsp; The golden boast<br />
Of Portugal and Western India there,<br />
The ruddier orange and the paler lime,<br />
Peep through their polished foliage at the storm,<br />
And seem to smile at what they need not fear.<br />
The amomum there with intermingling flowers<br />
And cherries hangs her twigs.&nbsp; Geranium boasts<br />
Her crimson honours, and the spangled beau,<br />
Ficoides, glitters bright the winter long,<br />
All plants, of every leaf, that can endure<br />
The winter&rsquo;s frown if screened from his shrewd bite,<br />
Live there and prosper.&nbsp; Those Ausonia claims,<br />
Levantine regions these; the Azores send<br />
Their jessamine; her jessamine remote<br />
Caffraria: foreigners from many lands,<br />
They form one social shade, as if convened<br />
By magic summons of the Orphean lyre.<br />
Yet such arrangement, rarely brought to pass<br />
But by a master&rsquo;s hand, disposing well<br />
The gay diversities of leaf and flower,<br />
Must lend its aid to illustrate all their charms,<br />
And dress the regular yet various scene.<br />
Plant behind plant aspiring, in the van<br />
The dwarfish, in the rear retired, but still<br />
Sublime above the rest, the statelier stand.<br />
So once were ranged the sons of ancient Rome,<br />
A noble show, while Roscius trod the stage;<br />
And so, while Garrick, as renowned as he,<br />
The sons of Albion, fearing each to lose<br />
Some note of Nature&rsquo;s music from his lips,<br />
And covetous of Shakespeare&rsquo;s beauty, seen<br />
In every flash of his far-beaming eye.<br />
Nor taste alone and well-contrived display<br />
Suffice to give the marshalled ranks the grace<br />
Of their complete effect.&nbsp; Much yet remains<br />
Unsung, and many cares are yet behind<br />
And more laborious; cares on which depends<br />
Their vigour, injured soon, not soon restored.<br />
The soil must be renewed, which often washed<br />
Loses its treasure of salubrious salts,<br />
And disappoints the roots; the slender roots,<br />
Close interwoven where they meet the vase,<br />
Must smooth be shorn away; the sapless branch<br />
Must fly before the knife; the withered leaf<br />
Must be detached, and where it strews the floor<br />
Swept with a woman&rsquo;s neatness, breeding else<br />
Contagion, and disseminating death.<br />
Discharge but these kind offices (and who<br />
Would spare, that loves them, offices like these?)<br />
Well they reward the toil.&nbsp; The sight is pleased,<br />
The scent regaled, each odoriferous leaf,<br />
Each opening blossom, freely breathes abroad<br />
Its gratitude, and thanks him with its sweets.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So manifold, all pleasing in
their kind,<br />
All healthful, are the employs of rural life,<br />
Reiterated as the wheel of time<br />
Runs round, still ending, and beginning still.<br />
Nor are these all.&nbsp; To deck the shapely knoll<br />
That, softly swelled and gaily dressed, appears<br />
A flowery island from the dark green lawn<br />
Emerging, must be deemed a labour due<br />
To no mean hand, and asks the touch of taste.<br />
Here also grateful mixture of well-matched<br />
And sorted hues (each giving each relief,<br />
And by contrasted beauty shining more)<br />
Is needful.&nbsp; Strength may wield the ponderous spade,<br />
May turn the clod, and wheel the compost home,<br />
But elegance, chief grace the garden shows<br />
And most attractive, is the fair result<br />
Of thought, the creature of a polished mind.<br />
Without it, all is Gothic as the scene<br />
To which the insipid citizen resorts,<br />
Near yonder heath; where industry misspent,<br />
But proud of his uncouth, ill-chosen task,<br />
Has made a heaven on earth; with suns and moons<br />
Of close-rammed stones has charged the encumbered soil,<br />
And fairly laid the zodiac in the dust.<br />
He, therefore, who would see his flowers disposed<br />
Sightly and in just order, ere he gives<br />
The beds the trusted treasure of their seeds,<br />
Forecasts the future whole; that when the scene<br />
Shall break into its preconceived display,<br />
Each for itself, and all as with one voice<br />
Conspiring, may attest his bright design.<br />
Nor even then, dismissing as performed<br />
His pleasant work, may he suppose it done.<br />
Few self-supported flowers endure the wind<br />
Uninjured, but expect the upholding aid<br />
Of the smooth-shaven prop, and neatly tied<br />
Are wedded thus, like beauty to old age,<br />
For interest sake, the living to the dead.<br />
Some clothe the soil that feeds them, far diffused<br />
And lowly creeping, modest and yet fair;<br />
Like virtue, thriving most where little seen.<br />
Some, more aspiring, catch the neighbour shrub<br />
With clasping tendrils, and invest his branch,<br />
Else unadorned, with many a gay festoon<br />
And fragrant chaplet, recompensing well<br />
The strength they borrow with the grace they lend.<br />
All hate the rank society of weeds,<br />
Noisome, and very greedy to exhaust<br />
The impoverished earth; an overbearing race,<br />
That, like the multitude made faction-mad,<br />
Disturb good order, and degrade true worth.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh blest seclusion from a
jarring world,<br />
Which he, thus occupied, enjoys!&nbsp; Retreat<br />
Cannot, indeed, to guilty man restore<br />
Lost innocence, or cancel follies past;<br />
But it has peace, and much secures the mind<br />
From all assaults of evil; proving still<br />
A faithful barrier, not o&rsquo;erleaped with ease<br />
By vicious custom raging uncontrolled<br />
Abroad and desolating public life.<br />
When fierce temptation, seconded within<br />
By traitor appetite, and armed with darts<br />
Tempered in hell, invades the throbbing breast,<br />
To combat may be glorious, and success<br />
Perhaps may crown us, but to fly is safe.<br />
Had I the choice of sublunary good,<br />
What could I wish that I possess not here?<br />
Health, leisure; means to improve it, friendship, peace,<br />
No loose or wanton though a wandering muse,<br />
And constant occupation without care.<br />
Thus blest, I draw a picture of that bliss;<br />
Hopeless, indeed, that dissipated minds<br />
And profligate abusers of a world<br />
Created fair so much in vain for them,<br />
Should seek the guiltless joys that I describe,<br />
Allured by my report; but sure no less<br />
That self-condemned they must neglect the prize,<br />
And what they will not taste, must yet approve.<br />
What we admire we praise; and when we praise<br />
Advance it into notice, that, its worth<br />
Acknowledged, others may admire it too.<br />
I therefore recommend, though at the risk<br />
Of popular disgust, yet boldly still,<br />
The cause of piety and sacred truth<br />
And virtue, and those scenes which God ordained<br />
Should best secure them and promote them most;<br />
Scenes that I love, and with regret perceive<br />
Forsaken, or through folly not enjoyed.<br />
Pure is the nymph, though liberal of her smiles,<br />
And chaste, though unconfined, whom I extol.<br />
Not as the prince in Shushan, when he called,<br />
Vain-glorious of her charms, his Vashti forth,<br />
To grace the full pavilion.&nbsp; His design<br />
Was but to boast his own peculiar good,<br />
Which all might view with envy, none partake.<br />
My charmer is not mine alone; my sweets,<br />
And she that sweetens all my bitters, too,<br />
Nature, enchanting Nature, in whose form<br />
And lineaments divine I trace a hand<br />
That errs not, and find raptures still renewed,<br />
Is free to all men&mdash;universal prize.<br />
Strange that so fair a creature should yet want<br />
Admirers, and be destined to divide<br />
With meaner objects even the few she finds.<br />
Stript of her ornaments, her leaves and flowers,<br />
She loses all her influence.&nbsp; Cities then<br />
Attract us, and neglected Nature pines,<br />
Abandoned, as unworthy of our love.<br />
But are not wholesome airs, though unperfumed<br />
By roses, and clear suns, though scarcely felt,<br />
And groves, if unharmonious yet secure<br />
From clamour and whose very silence charms,<br />
To be preferred to smoke&mdash;to the eclipse<br />
That Metropolitan volcanoes make,<br />
Whose Stygian throats breathe darkness all day long,<br />
And to the stir of commerce, driving slow,<br />
And thundering loud with his ten thousand wheels?<br />
They would be, were not madness in the head<br />
And folly in the heart; were England now<br />
What England was, plain, hospitable, kind,<br />
And undebauched.&nbsp; But we have bid farewell<br />
To all the virtues of those better days,<br />
And all their honest pleasures.&nbsp; Mansions once<br />
Knew their own masters, and laborious hands<br />
That had survived the father, served the son.<br />
Now the legitimate and rightful lord<br />
Is but a transient guest, newly arrived<br />
And soon to be supplanted.&nbsp; He that saw<br />
His patrimonial timber cast its leaf,<br />
Sells the last scantling, and transfers the price<br />
To some shrewd sharper, ere it buds again.<br />
Estates are landscapes, gazed upon awhile,<br />
Then advertised, and auctioneered away.<br />
The country starves, and they that feed the o&rsquo;er-charged<br
/>
And surfeited lewd town with her fair dues,<br />
By a just judgment strip and starve themselves.<br />
The wings that waft our riches out of sight<br />
Grow on the gamester&rsquo;s elbows, and the alert<br />
And nimble motion of those restless joints,<br />
That never tire, soon fans them all away.<br />
Improvement too, the idol of the age,<br />
Is fed with many a victim.&nbsp; Lo! he comes&mdash;<br />
The omnipotent magician, Brown, appears.<br />
Down falls the venerable pile, the abode<br />
Of our forefathers, a grave whiskered race,<br />
But tasteless.&nbsp; Springs a palace in its stead,<br />
But in a distant spot; where more exposed<br />
It may enjoy the advantage of the North<br />
And aguish East, till time shall have transformed<br />
Those naked acres to a sheltering grove.<br />
He speaks.&nbsp; The lake in front becomes a lawn,<br />
Woods vanish, hills subside, and valleys rise,<br />
And streams, as if created for his use,<br />
Pursue the track of his directed wand<br />
Sinuous or straight, now rapid and now slow,<br />
Now murmuring soft, now roaring in cascades,<br />
Even as he bids.&nbsp; The enraptured owner smiles.<br />
&rsquo;Tis finished.&nbsp; And yet, finished as it seems,<br />
Still wants a grace, the loveliest it could show,<br />
A mine to satisfy the enormous cost.<br />
Drained to the last poor item of his wealth,<br />
He sighs, departs, and leaves the accomplished plan<br />
That he has touched and retouched, many a day<br />
Laboured, and many a night pursued in dreams,<br />
Just when it meets his hopes, and proves the heaven<br />
He wanted, for a wealthier to enjoy.<br />
And now perhaps the glorious hour is come,<br />
When having no stake left, no pledge to endear<br />
Her interests, or that gives her sacred cause<br />
A moment&rsquo;s operation on his love,<br />
He burns with most intense and flagrant zeal<br />
To serve his country.&nbsp; Ministerial grace<br />
Deals him out money from the public chest,<br />
Or, if that mine be shut, some private purse<br />
Supplies his need with an usurious loan,<br />
To be refunded duly, when his vote,<br />
Well-managed, shall have earned its worthy price.<br />
Oh, innocent compared with arts like these,<br />
Crape and cocked pistol and the whistling ball<br />
Sent through the traveller&rsquo;s temples!&nbsp; He that
finds<br />
One drop of heaven&rsquo;s sweet mercy in his cup,<br />
Can dig, beg, rot, and perish well-content,<br />
So he may wrap himself in honest rags<br />
At his last gasp; but could not for a world<br />
Fish up his dirty and dependent bread<br />
From pools and ditches of the commonwealth,<br />
Sordid and sickening at his own success.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambition, avarice, penury
incurred<br />
By endless riot, vanity, the lust<br />
Of pleasure and variety, despatch,<br />
As duly as the swallows disappear,<br />
The world of wandering knights and squires to town;<br />
London engulfs them all.&nbsp; The shark is there,<br />
And the shark&rsquo;s prey; the spendthrift, and the leech<br />
That sucks him.&nbsp; There the sycophant, and he<br />
That with bare-headed and obsequious bows<br />
Begs a warm office, doomed to a cold jail<br />
And groat per diem if his patron frown.<br />
The levee swarms, as if in golden pomp<br />
Were charactered on every statesman&rsquo;s door,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Battered and bankrupt fortunes mended
here</span>.&rsquo;<br />
These are the charms that sully and eclipse<br />
The charms of nature.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the cruel gripe<br />
That lean hard-handed poverty inflicts,<br />
The hope of better things, the chance to win,<br />
The wish to shine, the thirst to be amused,<br />
That, at the sound of Winter&rsquo;s hoary wing,<br />
Unpeople all our counties of such herds<br />
Of fluttering, loitering, cringing, begging, loose<br />
And wanton vagrants, as make London, vast<br />
And boundless as it is, a crowded coop.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh thou resort and mart of
all the earth,<br />
Chequered with all complexions of mankind,<br />
And spotted with all crimes; in whom I see<br />
Much that I love, and more that I admire,<br />
And all that I abhor; thou freckled fair<br />
That pleases and yet shocks me, I can laugh<br />
And I can weep, can hope, and can despond,<br />
Feel wrath and pity when I think on thee!<br />
Ten righteous would have saved a city once,<br />
And thou hast many righteous.&mdash;Well for thee&mdash;<br />
That salt preserves thee; more corrupted else,<br />
And therefore more obnoxious at this hour<br />
Than Sodom in her day had power to be,<br />
For whom God heard his Abram plead in vain.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE WINTER EVENING.</span></h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Hark</span>! &rsquo;tis the
twanging horn o&rsquo;er yonder bridge,<br />
That with its wearisome but needful length<br />
Bestrides the wintry flood, in which the moon<br />
Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright;&mdash;<br />
He comes, the herald of a noisy world,<br />
With spattered boots, strapped waist, and frozen locks,<br />
News from all nations lumbering at his back.<br />
True to his charge the close-packed load behind,<br />
Yet careless what he brings, his one concern<br />
Is to conduct it to the destined inn,<br />
And, having dropped the expected bag&mdash;pass on.<br />
He whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch,<br />
Cold and yet cheerful: messenger of grief<br />
Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some;<br />
To him indifferent whether grief or joy.<br />
Houses in ashes, and the fall of stocks,<br />
Births, deaths, and marriages, epistles wet<br />
With tears that trickled down the writer&rsquo;s cheeks,<br />
Fast as the periods from his fluent quill,<br />
Or charged with amorous sighs of absent swains,<br />
Or nymphs responsive, equally affect<br />
His horse and him, unconscious of them all.<br />

With such heart-shaking music, who can say<br />
What are its tidings? have our troops awaked?<br />
Or do they still, as if with opium drugged,<br />
Snore to the murmurs of the Atlantic wave?<br />
Is India free? and does she wear her plumed<br />
And jewelled turban with a smile of peace,<br />
Or do we grind her still?&nbsp; The grand debate,<br />
The popular harangue, the tart reply,<br />
The logic and the wisdom and the wit<br />
And the loud laugh&mdash;I long to know them all;<br />
I burn to set the imprisoned wranglers free,<br />
And give them voice and utterance once again.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now stir the fire, and close
the shutters fast,<br />
Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,<br />
And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn<br />
Throws up a steamy column, and the cups,<br />
That cheer but not inebriate, wait on each,<br />
So let us welcome peaceful evening in.<br />
Not such his evening, who with shining face<br />
Sweats in the crowded theatre, and squeezed<br />
And bored with elbow-points through both his sides,<br />
Outscolds the ranting actor on the stage;<br />
Nor his, who patient stands till his feet throb<br />
And his head thumps, to feed upon the breath<br />
Of patriots bursting with heroic rage,<br />
Or placemen all tranquillity and smiles.<br />
This folio of four pages, happy work!<br />
Which not even critics criticise, that holds<br />
Inquisitive attention while I read<br />
Fast bound in chains of silence, which the fair,<br />
Though eloquent themselves, yet fear to break,<br />
What is it but a map of busy life,<br />
Its fluctuations and its vast concerns?<br />
Here runs the mountainous and craggy ridge<br />
That tempts ambition.&nbsp; On the summit, see,<br />
The seals of office glitter in his eyes;<br />
He climbs, he pants, he grasps them.&nbsp; At his heels,<br />
Close at his heels, a demagogue ascends,<br />
And with a dextrous jerk soon twists him down<br />
And wins them, but to lose them in his turn.<br />
Here rills of oily eloquence, in soft<br />
Meanders, lubricate the course they take;<br />
The modest speaker is ashamed and grieved<br />
To engross a moment&rsquo;s notice, and yet begs,<br />
Begs a propitious ear for his poor thoughts,<br />
However trivial all that he conceives.<br />
Sweet bashfulness! it claims, at least, this praise,<br />
The dearth of information and good sense<br />
That it foretells us, always comes to pass.<br />
Cataracts of declamation thunder here,<br />
There forests of no meaning spread the page<br />
In which all comprehension wanders lost;<br />
While fields of pleasantry amuse us there,<br />
With merry descants on a nation&rsquo;s woes.<br />
The rest appears a wilderness of strange<br />
But gay confusion; roses for the cheeks<br />
And lilies for the brows of faded age,<br />
Teeth for the toothless, ringlets for the bald,<br />
Heaven, earth, and ocean plundered of their sweets.<br />
Nectareous essences, Olympian dews,<br />
Sermons and city feasts and favourite airs,<br />
Ethereal journeys, submarine exploits,<br />
And Katterfelto with his hair on end<br />
At his own wonders, wondering for his bread.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis pleasant through
the loopholes of retreat<br />
To peep at such a world; to see the stir<br />
Of the great Babel and not feel the crowd;<br />
To hear the roar she sends through all her gates<br />
At a safe distance, where the dying sound<br />
Falls a soft murmur on the uninjured ear.<br />
Thus sitting and surveying thus at ease<br />
The globe and its concerns, I seem advanced<br />
To some secure and more than mortal height,<br />
That liberates and exempts me from them all.<br />
It turns submitted to my view, turns round<br />
With all its generations; I behold<br />
The tumult and am still.&nbsp; The sound of war<br />
Has lost its terrors ere it reaches me;<br />
Grieves, but alarms me not.&nbsp; I mourn the pride<br />
And avarice that makes man a wolf to man;<br />
Hear the faint echo of those brazen throats<br />
By which he speaks the language of his heart,<br />
And sigh, but never tremble at the sound.<br />
He travels and expatiates, as the bee<br />
From flower to flower so he from land to land;<br />
The manners, customs, policy of all<br />
Pay contribution to the store he gleans,<br />
He sucks intelligence in every clime,<br />
And spreads the honey of his deep research<br />
At his return&mdash;a rich repast for me.<br />
He travels and I too.&nbsp; I tread his deck,<br />
Ascend his topmast, through his peering eyes<br />
Discover countries, with a kindred heart<br />
Suffer his woes and share in his escapes;<br />
While fancy, like the finger of a clock,<br />
Runs the great circuit, and is still at home.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh Winter, ruler of the
inverted year,<br />
Thy scattered hair with sleet-like ashes filled,<br />
Thy breath congealed upon thy lips, thy cheeks<br />
Fringed with a beard made white with other snows<br />
Than those of age, thy forehead wrapped in clouds,<br />
A leafless branch thy sceptre, and thy throne<br />
A sliding car indebted to no wheels,<br />
But urged by storms along its slippery way,<br />
I love thee, all unlovely as thou seem&rsquo;st,<br />
And dreaded as thou art.&nbsp; Thou hold&rsquo;st the sun<br />
A prisoner in the yet undawning East,<br />
Shortening his journey between morn and noon,<br />
And hurrying him, impatient of his stay,<br />
Down to the rosy west; but kindly still<br />
Compensating his loss with added hours<br />
Of social converse and instructive ease,<br />
And gathering at short notice in one group<br />
The family dispersed, and fixing thought<br />
Not less dispersed by daylight and its cares.<br />
I crown thee king of intimate delights,<br />
Fire-side enjoyments, home-born happiness,<br />
And all the comforts that the lowly roof<br />
Of undisturbed retirement, and the hours<br />
Of long uninterrupted evening know.<br />
No rattling wheels stop short before these gates;<br />
No powdered pert proficients in the art<br />
Of sounding an alarm, assault these doors<br />
Till the street rings; no stationary steeds<br />
Cough their own knell, while heedless of the sound<br />
The silent circle fan themselves, and quake:<br />
But here the needle plies its busy task,<br />
The pattern grows, the well-depicted flower,<br />
Wrought patiently into the snowy lawn,<br />
Unfolds its bosom; buds and leaves and sprigs<br />
And curly tendrils, gracefully disposed,<br />
Follow the nimble finger of the fair;<br />
A wreath that cannot fade, of flowers that blow<br />
With most success when all besides decay.<br />
The poet&rsquo;s or historian&rsquo;s page, by one<br />
Made vocal for the amusement of the rest;<br />
The sprightly lyre, whose treasure of sweet sounds<br />
The touch from many a trembling chord shakes out;<br />
And the clear voice symphonious, yet distinct,<br />
And in the charming strife triumphant still,<br />
Beguile the night, and set a keener edge<br />
On female industry; the threaded steel<br />
Flies swiftly, and unfelt the task proceeds.<br />
The volume closed, the customary rites<br />
Of the last meal commence: a Roman meal,<br />
Such as the mistress of the world once found<br />
Delicious, when her patriots of high note,<br />
Perhaps by moonlight, at their humble doors,<br />
And under an old oak&rsquo;s domestic shade,<br />
Enjoyed&mdash;spare feast!&mdash;a radish and an egg.<br />
Discourse ensues, not trivial, yet not dull,<br />
Nor such as with a frown forbids the play<br />
Of fancy, or proscribes the sound of mirth;<br />
Nor do we madly, like an impious world,<br />
Who deem religion frenzy, and the God<br />
That made them an intruder on their joys,<br />
Start at His awful name, or deem His praise<br />
A jarring note; themes of a graver tone<br />
Exciting oft our gratitude and love,<br />
While we retrace with memory&rsquo;s pointing wand<br />
That calls the past to our exact review,<br />
The dangers we have scaped, the broken snare,<br />
The disappointed foe, deliverance found<br />
Unlooked for, life preserved and peace restored,<br />
Fruits of omnipotent eternal love:&mdash;<br />
Oh evenings worthy of the gods! exclaimed<br />
The Sabine bard.&nbsp; Oh evenings, I reply,<br />
More to be prized and coveted than yours,<br />
As more illumined and with nobler truths,<br />
That I, and mine, and those we love, enjoy.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Winter hideous in a garb
like this?<br />
Needs he the tragic fur, the smoke of lamps,<br />
The pent-up breath of an unsavoury throng<br />
To thaw him into feeling, or the smart<br />
And snappish dialogue that flippant wits<br />
Call comedy, to prompt him with a smile?<br />
The self-complacent actor, when he views<br />
(Stealing a sidelong glance at a full house)<br />
The slope of faces from the floor to the roof,<br />
As if one master-spring controlled them all,<br />
Relaxed into an universal grin,<br />
Sees not a countenance there that speaks a joy<br />
Half so refined or so sincere as ours.<br />
Cards were superfluous here, with all the tricks<br />
That idleness has ever yet contrived<br />
To fill the void of an unfurnished brain,<br />
To palliate dulness and give time a shove.<br />
Time, as he passes us, has a dove&rsquo;s wing,<br />
Unsoiled and swift and of a silken sound.<br />
But the world&rsquo;s time is time in masquerade.<br />
Theirs, should I paint him, has his pinions fledged<br />
With motley plumes, and, where the peacock shows<br />
His azure eyes, is tinctured black and red<br />
With spots quadrangular of diamond form,<br />
Ensanguined hearts, clubs typical of strife,<br />
And spades, the emblem of untimely graves.<br />
What should be, and what was an hour-glass once,<br />
Becomes a dice-box, and a billiard mast<br />
Well does the work of his destructive scythe.<br />
Thus decked he charms a world whom fashion blinds<br />
To his true worth, most pleased when idle most,<br />
Whose only happy are their wasted hours.<br />
Even misses, at whose age their mothers wore<br />
The back-string and the bib, assume the dress<br />
Of womanhood, sit pupils in the school<br />
Of card-devoted time, and night by night,<br />
Placed at some vacant corner of the board,<br />
Learn every trick, and soon play all the game.<br />
But truce with censure.&nbsp; Roving as I rove,<br />
Where shall I find an end, or how proceed?<br />
As he that travels far, oft turns aside<br />
To view some rugged rock, or mouldering tower,<br />
Which seen delights him not; then coming home,<br />
Describes and prints it, that the world may know<br />
How far he went for what was nothing worth;<br />
So I, with brush in hand and pallet spread<br />
With colours mixed for a far different use,<br />
Paint cards and dolls, and every idle thing<br />
That fancy finds in her excursive flights.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, Evening, once again,
season of peace,<br />
Return, sweet Evening, and continue long!<br />
Methinks I see thee in the streaky west,<br />
With matron-step slow moving, while the night<br />
Treads on thy sweeping train; one hand employed<br />
In letting fall the curtain of repose<br />
On bird and beast, the other charged for man<br />
With sweet oblivion of the cares of day;<br />
Not sumptuously adorned, nor needing aid,<br />
Like homely-featured night, of clustering gems,<br />
A star or two just twinkling on thy brow<br />
Suffices thee; save that the moon is thine<br />
No less than hers, not worn indeed on high<br />
With ostentatious pageantry, but set<br />
With modest grandeur in thy purple zone,<br />
Resplendent less, but of an ampler round.<br />
Come, then, and thou shalt find thy votary calm,<br />
Or make me so.&nbsp; Composure is thy gift;<br />
And whether I devote thy gentle hours<br />
To books, to music, or to poet&rsquo;s toil,<br />
To weaving nets for bird-alluring fruit,<br />
Or twining silken threads round ivory reels<br />
When they command whom man was born to please,<br />
I slight thee not, but make thee welcome still.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just when our drawing-rooms
begin to blaze<br />
With lights, by clear reflection multiplied<br />
From many a mirror, in which he of Gath,<br />
Goliath, might have seen his giant bulk<br />
Whole without stooping, towering crest and all,<br />
My pleasures too begin.&nbsp; But me perhaps<br />
The glowing hearth may satisfy a while<br />
With faint illumination, that uplifts<br />
The shadow to the ceiling, there by fits<br />
Dancing uncouthly to the quivering flame.<br />
Not undelightful is an hour to me<br />
So spent in parlour twilight; such a gloom<br />
Suits well the thoughtful or unthinking mind,<br />
The mind contemplative, with some new theme<br />
Pregnant, or indisposed alike to all.<br />
Laugh ye, who boast your more mercurial powers<br />
That never feel a stupor, know no pause,<br />
Nor need one; I am conscious, and confess.<br />
Fearless, a soul that does not always think.<br />
Me oft has fancy ludicrous and wild<br />
Soothed with a waking dream of houses, towers,<br />
Trees, churches, and strange visages expressed<br />
In the red cinders, while with poring eye<br />
I gazed, myself creating what I saw.<br />
Nor less amused have I quiescent watched<br />
The sooty films that play upon the bars<br />
Pendulous, and foreboding in the view<br />
Of superstition, prophesying still,<br />
Though still deceived, some stranger&rsquo;s near approach.<br />
&rsquo;Tis thus the understanding takes repose<br />
In indolent vacuity of thought,<br />
And sleeps and is refreshed.&nbsp; Meanwhile the face<br />
Conceals the mood lethargic with a mask<br />
Of deep deliberation, as the man<br />
Were tasked to his full strength, absorbed and lost.<br />
Thus oft reclined at ease, I lose an hour<br />
At evening, till at length the freezing blast<br />
That sweeps the bolted shutter, summons home<br />
The recollected powers, and, snapping short<br />
The glassy threads with which the fancy weaves<br />
Her brittle toys, restores me to myself.<br />
How calm is my recess! and how the frost<br />
Raging abroad, and the rough wind, endear<br />
The silence and the warmth enjoyed within!<br />
I saw the woods and fields at close of day<br />
A variegated show; the meadows green<br />
Though faded, and the lands, where lately waved<br />
The golden harvest, of a mellow brown,<br />
Upturned so lately by the forceful share;<br />
I saw far off the weedy fallows smile<br />
With verdure not unprofitable, grazed<br />
By flocks fast feeding, and selecting each<br />
His favourite herb; while all the leafless groves<br />
That skirt the horizon wore a sable hue,<br />
Scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve.<br />
To-morrow brings a change, a total change,<br />
Which even now, though silently performed<br />
And slowly, and by most unfelt, the face<br />
Of universal nature undergoes.<br />
Fast falls a fleecy shower; the downy flakes,<br />
Descending and with never-ceasing lapse<br />
Softly alighting upon all below,<br />
Assimilate all objects.&nbsp; Earth receives<br />
Gladly the thickening mantle, and the green<br />
And tender blade, that feared the chilling blast,<br />
Escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a world, so thorny,
and where none<br />
Finds happiness unblighted, or if found,<br />
Without some thistly sorrow at its side,<br />
It seems the part of wisdom, and no sin<br />
Against the law of love, to measure lots<br />
With less distinguished than ourselves, that thus<br />
We may with patience bear our moderate ills,<br />
And sympathise with others, suffering more.<br />
Ill fares the traveller now, and he that stalks<br />
In ponderous boots beside his reeking team;<br />
The wain goes heavily, impeded sore<br />
By congregating loads adhering close<br />
To the clogged wheels, and, in its sluggish pace,<br />
Noiseless appears a moving hill of snow.<br />
The toiling steeds expand the nostril wide,<br />
While every breath, by respiration strong<br />
Forced downward, is consolidated soon<br />
Upon their jutting chests.&nbsp; He, formed to bear<br />
The pelting brunt of the tempestuous night,<br />
With half-shut eyes, and puckered cheeks, and teeth<br />
Presented bare against the storm, plods on;<br />
One hand secures his hat, save when with both<br />
He brandishes his pliant length of whip,<br />
Resounding oft, and never heard in vain.<br />
Oh happy, and, in my account, denied<br />
That sensibility of pain with which<br />
Refinement is endued, thrice happy thou!<br />
Thy frame, robust and hardy, feels indeed<br />
The piercing cold, but feels it unimpaired;<br />
The learned finger never need explore<br />
Thy vigorous pulse, and the unhealthful East,<br />
That breathes the spleen, and searches every bone<br />
Of the infirm, is wholesome air to thee.<br />
Thy days roll on exempt from household care,<br />
Thy waggon is thy wife; and the poor beasts,<br />
That drag the dull companion to and fro,<br />
Thine helpless charge, dependent on thy care.<br />
Ah, treat them kindly! rude as thou appearest,<br />
Yet show that thou hast mercy, which the great,<br />
With needless hurry whirled from place to place,<br />
Humane as they would seem, not always show.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor, yet industrious,
modest, quiet, neat,<br />
Such claim compassion in a night like this,<br />
And have a friend in every feeling heart.<br />
Warmed while it lasts, by labour, all day long<br />
They brave the season, and yet find at eve,<br />
Ill clad and fed but sparely, time to cool.<br />
The frugal housewife trembles when she lights<br />
Her scanty stock of brushwood, blazing clear,<br />
But dying soon, like all terrestrial joys;<br />
The few small embers left she nurses well.<br />
And while her infant race with outspread hands<br />
And crowded knees sit cowering o&rsquo;er the sparks,<br />
Retires, content to quake, so they be warmed.<br />
The man feels least, as more inured than she<br />
To winter, and the current in his veins<br />
More briskly moved by his severer toil;<br />
Yet he, too, finds his own distress in theirs.<br />
The taper soon extinguished, which I saw<br />
Dangled along at the cold finger&rsquo;s end<br />
Just when the day declined, and the brown loaf<br />
Lodged on the shelf, half-eaten, without sauce<br />
Of sav&rsquo;ry cheese, or butter costlier still,<br />
Sleep seems their only refuge.&nbsp; For alas,<br />
Where penury is felt the thought is chained,<br />
And sweet colloquial pleasures are but few.<br />
With all this thrift they thrive not.&nbsp; All the care<br />
Ingenious parsimony takes, but just<br />
Saves the small inventory, bed and stool,<br />
Skillet and old carved chest, from public sale.<br />
They live, and live without extorted alms<br />
From grudging hands, but other boast have none<br />
To soothe their honest pride that scorns to beg,<br />
Nor comfort else, but in their mutual love.<br />
I praise you much, ye meek and patient pair,<br />
For ye are worthy; choosing rather far<br />
A dry but independent crust, hard-earned<br />
And eaten with a sigh, than to endure<br />
The rugged frowns and insolent rebuffs<br />
Of knaves in office, partial in their work<br />
Of distribution; liberal of their aid<br />
To clamorous importunity in rags,<br />
But ofttimes deaf to suppliants who would blush<br />
To wear a tattered garb however coarse,<br />
Whom famine cannot reconcile to filth;<br />
These ask with painful shyness, and, refused<br />
Because deserving, silently retire.<br />
But be ye of good courage!&nbsp; Time itself<br />
Shall much befriend you.&nbsp; Time shall give increase,<br />
And all your numerous progeny, well trained,<br />
But helpless, in few years shall find their hands,<br />
And labour too.&nbsp; Meanwhile ye shall not want<br />
What, conscious of your virtues, we can spare,<br />
Nor what a wealthier than ourselves may send.<br />
I mean the man, who when the distant poor<br />
Need help, denies them nothing but his name.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But poverty with most, who
whimper forth<br />
Their long complaints, is self-inflicted woe,<br />
The effect of laziness or sottish waste.<br />
Now goes the nightly thief prowling abroad<br />
For plunder; much solicitous how best<br />
He may compensate for a day of sloth,<br />
By works of darkness and nocturnal wrong,<br />
Woe to the gardener&rsquo;s pale, the farmer&rsquo;s hedge<br />
Plashed neatly and secured with driven stakes<br />
Deep in the loamy bank.&nbsp; Uptorn by strength<br />
Resistless in so bad a cause, but lame<br />
To better deeds, he bundles up the spoil&mdash;<br />
An ass&rsquo;s burden,&mdash;and when laden most<br />
And heaviest, light of foot steals fast away.<br />
Nor does the boarded hovel better guard<br />
The well-stacked pile of riven logs and roots<br />
From his pernicious force.&nbsp; Nor will he leave<br />
Unwrenched the door, however well secured,<br />
Where chanticleer amidst his harem sleeps<br />
In unsuspecting pomp; twitched from the perch<br />
He gives the princely bird with all his wives<br />
To his voracious bag, struggling in vain,<br />
And loudly wondering at the sudden change.<br />
Nor this to feed his own.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twere some excuse<br />
Did pity of their sufferings warp aside<br />
His principle, and tempt him into sin<br />
For their support, so destitute; but they<br />
Neglected pine at home, themselves, as more<br />
Exposed than others, with less scruple made<br />
His victims, robbed of their defenceless all.<br />
Cruel is all he does.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis quenchless thirst<br />
Of ruinous ebriety that prompts<br />
His every action, and imbrutes the man.<br />
Oh for a law to noose the villain&rsquo;s neck<br />
Who starves his own; who persecutes the blood<br />
He gave them in his children&rsquo;s veins, and hates<br />
And wrongs the woman he has sworn to love.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass where we may, through
city, or through town,<br />
Village or hamlet of this merry land,<br />
Though lean and beggared, every twentieth pace<br />
Conducts the unguarded nose to such a whiff<br />
Of stale debauch, forth-issuing from the styes<br />
That law has licensed, as makes temperance reel.<br />
There sit involved and lost in curling clouds<br />
Of Indian fume, and guzzling deep, the boor,<br />
The lackey, and the groom.&nbsp; The craftsman there<br />
Takes a Lethean leave of all his toil;<br />
Smith, cobbler, joiner, he that plies the shears,<br />
And he that kneads the dough: all loud alike,<br />
All learned, and all drunk.&nbsp; The fiddle screams<br />
Plaintive and piteous, as it wept and wailed<br />
Its wasted tones and harmony unheard;<br />
Fierce the dispute, whate&rsquo;er the theme; while she,<br />
Fell Discord, arbitress of such debate,<br />
Perched on the sign-post, holds with even hand<br />
Her undecisive scales.&nbsp; In this she lays<br />
A weight of ignorance, in that, of pride,<br />
And smiles delighted with the eternal poise.<br />
Dire is the frequent curse and its twin sound<br />
The cheek-distending oath, not to be praised<br />
As ornamental, musical, polite,<br />
Like those which modern senators employ,<br />
Whose oath is rhetoric, and who swear for fame.<br />
Behold the schools in which plebeian minds,<br />
Once simple, are initiated in arts<br />
Which some may practise with politer grace,<br />
But none with readier skill!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis here they learn<br
/>
The road that leads from competence and peace<br />
To indigence and rapine; till at last<br />
Society, grown weary of the load,<br />
Shakes her encumbered lap, and casts them out.<br />
But censure profits little.&nbsp; Vain the attempt<br />
To advertise in verse a public pest,<br />
That, like the filth with which the peasant feeds<br />
His hungry acres, stinks and is of use.<br />
The excise is fattened with the rich result<br />
Of all this riot; and ten thousand casks,<br />
For ever dribbling out their base contents,<br />
Touched by the Midas finger of the state,<br />
Bleed gold for Ministers to sport away.<br />
Drink and be mad then; &rsquo;tis your country bids!<br />
Gloriously drunk, obey the important call,<br />
Her cause demands the assistance of your throats;&mdash;<br />
Ye all can swallow, and she asks no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would I had fallen upon those
happier days<br />
That poets celebrate; those golden times<br />
And those Arcadian scenes that Maro sings,<br />
And Sidney, warbler of poetic prose.<br />
Nymphs were Dianas then, and swains had hearts<br />
That felt their virtues.&nbsp; Innocence, it seems,<br />
From courts dismissed, found shelter in the groves;<br />
The footsteps of simplicity, impressed<br />
Upon the yielding herbage (so they sing),<br />
Then were not all effaced.&nbsp; Then speech profane<br />
And manners profligate were rarely found,<br />
Observed as prodigies, and soon reclaimed.<br />
Vain wish! those days were never: airy dreams<br />
Sat for the picture; and the poet&rsquo;s hand,<br />
Imparting substance to an empty shade,<br />
Imposed a gay delirium for a truth.<br />
Grant it: I still must envy them an age<br />
That favoured such a dream, in days like these<br />
Impossible, when virtue is so scarce<br />
That to suppose a scene where she presides<br />
Is tramontane, and stumbles all belief.<br />
No.&nbsp; We are polished now.&nbsp; The rural lass,<br />
Whom once her virgin modesty and grace,<br />
Her artless manners and her neat attire,<br />
So dignified, that she was hardly less<br />
Than the fair shepherdess of old romance,<br />
Is seen no more.&nbsp; The character is lost.<br />
Her head adorned with lappets pinned aloft<br />
And ribbons streaming gay, superbly raised<br />
And magnified beyond all human size,<br />
Indebted to some smart wig-weaver&rsquo;s hand<br />
For more than half the tresses it sustains;<br />
Her elbows ruffled, and her tottering form<br />
Ill propped upon French heels; she might be deemed<br />
(But that the basket dangling on her arm<br />
Interprets her more truly) of a rank<br />
Too proud for dairy-work, or sale of eggs;<br />
Expect her soon with foot-boy at her heels,<br />
No longer blushing for her awkward load,<br />
Her train and her umbrella all her care.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town has tinged the
country; and the stain<br />
Appears a spot upon a vestal&rsquo;s robe,<br />
The worse for what it soils.&nbsp; The fashion runs<br />
Down into scenes still rural, but alas,<br />
Scenes rarely graced with rural manners now.<br />
Time was when in the pastoral retreat<br />
The unguarded door was safe; men did not watch<br />
To invade another&rsquo;s right, or guard their own.<br />
Then sleep was undisturbed by fear, unscared<br />
By drunken howlings; and the chilling tale<br />
Of midnight murder was a wonder heard<br />
With doubtful credit, told to frighten babes<br />
But farewell now to unsuspicious nights,<br />
And slumbers unalarmed.&nbsp; Now, ere you sleep,<br />
See that your polished arms be primed with care,<br />
And drop the night-bolt.&nbsp; Ruffians are abroad,<br />
And the first larum of the cock&rsquo;s shrill throat<br />
May prove a trumpet, summoning your ear<br />
To horrid sounds of hostile feet within.<br />
Even daylight has its dangers; and the walk<br />
Through pathless wastes and woods, unconscious once<br />
Of other tenants than melodious birds,<br />
Or harmless flocks, is hazardous and bold.<br />
Lamented change! to which full many a cause<br />
Inveterate, hopeless of a cure, conspires.<br />
The course of human things from good to ill,<br />
From ill to worse, is fatal, never fails.<br />
Increase of power begets increase of wealth;<br />
Wealth luxury, and luxury excess;<br />
Excess, the scrofulous and itchy plague<br />
That seizes first the opulent, descends<br />
To the next rank contagious, and in time<br />
Taints downward all the graduated scale<br />
Of order, from the chariot to the plough.<br />
The rich, and they that have an arm to check<br />
The licence of the lowest in degree,<br />
Desert their office; and themselves, intent<br />
On pleasure, haunt the capital, and thus<br />
To all the violence of lawless hands<br />
Resign the scenes their presence might protect.<br />
Authority itself not seldom sleeps,<br />
Though resident, and witness of the wrong.<br />
The plump convivial parson often bears<br />
The magisterial sword in vain, and lays<br />
His reverence and his worship both to rest<br />
On the same cushion of habitual sloth.<br />
Perhaps timidity restrains his arm,<br />
When he should strike he trembles, and sets free,<br />
Himself enslaved by terror of the band,<br />
The audacious convict whom he dares not bind.<br />
Perhaps, though by profession ghostly pure,<br />
He, too, may have his vice, and sometimes prove<br />
Less dainty than becomes his grave outside<br />
In lucrative concerns.&nbsp; Examine well<br />
His milk-white hand.&nbsp; The palm is hardly clean&mdash;<br />
But here and there an ugly smutch appears.<br />
Foh! &rsquo;twas a bribe that left it.&nbsp; He has touched<br />
Corruption.&nbsp; Whoso seeks an audit here<br />
Propitious, pays his tribute, game or fish,<br />
Wildfowl or venison, and his errand speeds.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But faster far and more than
all the rest<br />
A noble cause, which none who bears a spark<br />
Of public virtue ever wished removed,<br />
Works the deplored and mischievous effect.<br />
&rsquo;Tis universal soldiership has stabbed<br />
The heart of merit in the meaner class.<br />
Arms, through the vanity and brainless rage<br />
Of those that bear them, in whatever cause,<br />
Seem most at variance with all moral good,<br />
And incompatible with serious thought.<br />
The clown, the child of nature, without guile,<br />
Blest with an infant&rsquo;s ignorance of all<br />
But his own simple pleasures, now and then<br />
A wrestling match, a foot-race, or a fair,<br />
Is balloted, and trembles at the news.<br />
Sheepish he doffs his hat, and mumbling swears<br />
A Bible-oath to be whate&rsquo;er they please,<br />
To do he knows not what.&nbsp; The task performed,<br />
That instant he becomes the serjeant&rsquo;s care,<br />
His pupil, and his torment, and his jest;<br />
His awkward gait, his introverted toes,<br />
Bent knees, round shoulders, and dejected looks,<br />
Procure him many a curse.&nbsp; By slow degrees,<br />
Unapt to learn and formed of stubborn stuff,<br />
He yet by slow degrees puts off himself,<br />
Grows conscious of a change, and likes it well.<br />
He stands erect, his slouch becomes a walk,<br />
He steps right onward, martial in his air,<br />
His form and movement; is as smart above<br />
As meal and larded locks can make him: wears<br />
His hat or his plumed helmet with a grace,<br />
And, his three years of heroship expired,<br />
Returns indignant to the slighted plough.<br />
He hates the field in which no fife or drum<br />
Attends him, drives his cattle to a march,<br />
And sighs for the smart comrades he has left.<br />
&rsquo;Twere well if his exterior change were all&mdash;<br />
But with his clumsy port the wretch has lost<br />
His ignorance and harmless manners too.<br />
To swear, to game, to drink, to show at home<br />
By lewdness, idleness, and Sabbath-breach,<br />
The great proficiency he made abroad,<br />
To astonish and to grieve his gazing friends,<br />
To break some maiden&rsquo;s and his mother&rsquo;s heart,<br />
To be a pest where he was useful once,<br />
Are his sole aim, and all his glory now!<br />
Man in society is like a flower<br />
Blown in its native bed.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis there alone<br />
His faculties expanded in full bloom<br />
Shine out, there only reach their proper use.<br />
But man associated and leagued with man<br />
By regal warrant, or self-joined by bond<br />
For interest sake, or swarming into clans<br />
Beneath one head for purposes of war,<br />
Like flowers selected from the rest, and bound<br />
And bundled close to fill some crowded vase,<br />
Fades rapidly, and by compression marred<br />
Contracts defilement not to be endured.<br />
Hence chartered boroughs are such public plagues,<br />
And burghers, men immaculate perhaps<br />
In all their private functions, once combined,<br />
Become a loathsome body, only fit<br />
For dissolution, hurtful to the main.<br />
Hence merchants, unimpeachable of sin<br />
Against the charities of domestic life,<br />
Incorporated, seem at once to lose<br />
Their nature, and, disclaiming all regard<br />
For mercy and the common rights of man,<br />
Build factories with blood, conducting trade<br />
At the sword&rsquo;s point, and dyeing the white robe<br />
Of innocent commercial justice red.<br />
Hence too the field of glory, as the world<br />
Misdeems it, dazzled by its bright array,<br />
With all the majesty of thundering pomp,<br />
Enchanting music and immortal wreaths,<br />
Is but a school where thoughtlessness is taught<br />
On principle, where foppery atones<br />
For folly, gallantry for every vice.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But slighted as it is, and by
the great<br />
Abandoned, and, which still I more regret,<br />
Infected with the manners and the modes<br />
It knew not once, the country wins me still.<br />
I never framed a wish or formed a plan<br />
That flattered me with hopes of earthly bliss,<br />
But there I laid the scene.&nbsp; There early strayed<br />
My fancy, ere yet liberty of choice<br />
Had found me, or the hope of being free.<br />
My very dreams were rural, rural too<br />
The first-born efforts of my youthful muse,<br />
Sportive, and jingling her poetic bells<br />
Ere yet her ear was mistress of their powers.<br />
No bard could please me but whose lyre was tuned<br />
To Nature&rsquo;s praises.&nbsp; Heroes and their feats<br />
Fatigued me, never weary of the pipe<br />
Of Tityrus, assembling as he sang<br />
The rustic throng beneath his favourite beech.<br />
Then Milton had indeed a poet&rsquo;s charms:<br />
New to my taste, his Paradise surpassed<br />
The struggling efforts of my boyish tongue<br />
To speak its excellence; I danced for joy.<br />
I marvelled much that, at so ripe an age<br />
As twice seven years, his beauties had then first<br />
Engaged my wonder, and admiring still,<br />
And still admiring, with regret supposed<br />
The joy half lost because not sooner found.<br />
Thee, too, enamoured of the life I loved,<br />
Pathetic in its praise, in its pursuit<br />
Determined, and possessing it at last<br />
With transports such as favoured lovers feel,<br />
I studied, prized, and wished that I had known,<br />
Ingenious Cowley: and though now, reclaimed<br />
By modern lights from an erroneous taste,<br />
I cannot but lament thy splendid wit<br />
Entangled in the cobwebs of the schools.<br />
I still revere thee, courtly though retired,<br />
Though stretched at ease in Chertsey&rsquo;s silent bowers,<br />
Not unemployed, and finding rich amends<br />
For a lost world in solitude and verse.<br />
&rsquo;Tis born with all.&nbsp; The love of Nature&rsquo;s
works<br />
Is an ingredient in the compound, man,<br />
Infused at the creation of the kind.<br />
And though the Almighty Maker has throughout<br />
Discriminated each from each, by strokes<br />
And touches of His hand, with so much art<br />
Diversified, that two were never found<br />
Twins at all points&mdash;yet this obtains in all,<br />
That all discern a beauty in His works,<br />
And all can taste them: minds that have been formed<br />
And tutored, with a relish more exact,<br />
But none without some relish, none unmoved.<br />
It is a flame that dies not even there,<br />
Where nothing feeds it.&nbsp; Neither business, crowds,<br />
Nor habits of luxurious city life,<br />
Whatever else they smother of true worth<br />
In human bosoms, quench it or abate.<br />
The villas, with which London stands begirt<br />
Like a swarth Indian with his belt of beads,<br />
Prove it.&nbsp; A breath of unadulterate air,<br />
The glimpse of a green pasture, how they cheer<br />
The citizen, and brace his languid frame!<br />
Even in the stifling bosom of the town,<br />
A garden in which nothing thrives, has charms<br />
That soothe the rich possessor; much consoled<br />
That here and there some sprigs of mournful mint,<br />
Of nightshade, or valerian, grace the well<br />
He cultivates.&nbsp; These serve him with a hint<br />
That Nature lives; that sight-refreshing green<br />
Is still the livery she delights to wear,<br />
Though sickly samples of the exuberant whole.<br />
What are the casements lined with creeping herbs,<br />
The prouder sashes fronted with a range<br />
Of orange, myrtle, or the fragrant weed,<br />
The Frenchman&rsquo;s darling? are they not all proofs<br />
That man, immured in cities, still retains<br />
His inborn inextinguishable thirst<br />
Of rural scenes, compensating his loss<br />
By supplemental shifts, the best he may?<br />
The most unfurnished with the means of life,<br />
And they that never pass their brick-wall bounds<br />
To range the fields, and treat their lungs with air,<br />
Yet feel the burning instinct: over-head<br />
Suspend their crazy boxes planted thick<br />
And watered duly.&nbsp; There the pitcher stands<br />
A fragment, and the spoutless tea-pot there;<br />
Sad witnesses how close-pent man regrets<br />
The country, with what ardour he contrives<br />
A peep at nature, when he can no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, therefore, patroness of
health and ease<br />
And contemplation, heart-consoling joys<br />
And harmless pleasures, in the thronged abode<br />
Of multitudes unknown, hail rural life!<br />
Address himself who will to the pursuit<br />
Of honours, or emolument, or fame,<br />
I shall not add myself to such a chase,<br />
Thwart his attempts, or envy his success.<br />
Some must be great.&nbsp; Great offices will have<br />
Great talents.&nbsp; And God gives to every man<br />
The virtue, temper, understanding, taste,<br />
That lifts him into life, and lets him fall<br />
Just in the niche he was ordained to fill.<br />
To the deliverer of an injured land<br />
He gives a tongue to enlarge upon, a heart<br />
To feel, and courage to redress her wrongs;<br />
To monarchs dignity, to judges sense;<br />
To artists ingenuity and skill;<br />
To me an unambitious mind, content<br />
In the low vale of life, that early felt<br />
A wish for ease and leisure, and ere long<br />
Found here that leisure and that ease I wished.</p>
<h3>BOOK V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WINTER MORNING WALK.</span></h3>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Tis</span> morning;
and the sun, with ruddy orb<br />
Ascending, fires the horizon; while the clouds,<br />
That crowd away before the driving wind,<br />
More ardent as the disk emerges more,<br />
Resemble most some city in a blaze,<br />
Seen through the leafless wood.&nbsp; His slanting ray<br />
Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale,<br />
And, tingeing all with his own rosy hue,<br />
From every herb and every spiry blade<br />
Stretches a length of shadow o&rsquo;er the field,<br />
Mine, spindling into longitude immense,<br />
In spite of gravity, and sage remark<br />
That I myself am but a fleeting shade,<br />
Provokes me to a smile.&nbsp; With eye askance<br />
I view the muscular proportioned limb<br />
Transformed to a lean shank; the shapeless pair,<br />
As they designed to mock me, at my side<br />
Take step for step, and, as I near approach<br />
The cottage, walk along the plastered wall,<br />
Preposterous sight, the legs without the man.<br />
The verdure of the plain lies buried deep<br />
Beneath the dazzling deluge, and the bents<br />
And coarser grass upspearing o&rsquo;er the rest,<br />
Of late unsightly and unseen, now shine<br />
Conspicuous, and, in bright apparel clad,<br />
And fledged with icy feathers, nod superb.<br />
The cattle mourn in corners, where the fence<br />
Screens them, and seem, half petrified, to sleep<br />
In unrecumbent sadness.&nbsp; There they wait<br />
Their wonted fodder, not, like hungering man,<br />
Fretful if unsupplied, but silent, meek,<br />
And patient of the slow-paced swain&rsquo;s delay.<br />
He from the stack carves out the accustomed load,<br />
Deep-plunging, and again deep-plunging oft<br />
His broad keen knife into the solid mass:<br />
Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands,<br />
With such undeviating and even force<br />
He severs it away: no needless care,<br />
Lest storms should overset the leaning pile<br />
Deciduous, or its own unbalanced weight.<br />
Forth goes the woodman, leaving unconcerned<br />
The cheerful haunts of man, to wield the axe<br />
And drive the wedge in yonder forest drear,<br />
From morn to eve his solitary task.<br />
Shaggy and lean and shrewd, with pointed ears<br />
And tail cropped short, half lurcher and half cur,<br />
His dog attends him.&nbsp; Close behind his heel<br />
Now creeps he slow, and now with many a frisk,<br />
Wide-scampering, snatches up the drifted snow<br />
With ivory teeth, or ploughs it with his snout;<br />
Then shakes his powdered coat and barks for joy.<br />
Heedless of all his pranks the sturdy churl<br />
Moves right toward the mark; nor stops for aught,<br />
But now and then, with pressure of his thumb,<br />
To adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube,<br />
That fumes beneath his nose; the trailing cloud<br />
Streams far behind him, scenting all the air.<br />
Now from the roost, or from the neighbouring pale,<br />
Where, diligent to catch the first faint gleam<br />
Of smiling day, they gossiped side by side,<br />
Come trooping at the housewife&rsquo;s well-known call<br />
The feathered tribes domestic; half on wing,<br />
And half on foot, they brush the fleecy flood,<br />
Conscious, and fearful of too deep a plunge.<br />
The sparrows peep, and quit the sheltering eaves<br />
To seize the fair occasion; well they eye<br />
The scattered grain, and, thievishly resolved<br />
To escape the impending famine, often scared<br />
As oft return, a pert, voracious kind.<br />
Clean riddance quickly made, one only care<br />
Remains to each, the search of sunny nook,<br />
Or shed impervious to the blast.&nbsp; Resigned<br />
To sad necessity the cock foregoes<br />
His wonted strut, and, wading at their head<br />
With well-considered steps, seems to resent<br />
His altered gait, and stateliness retrenched.<br />
How find the myriads, that in summer cheer<br />
The hills and valleys with their ceaseless songs,<br />
Due sustenance, or where subsist they now?<br />
Earth yields them naught: the imprisoned worm is safe<br />
Beneath the frozen clod; all seeds of herbs<br />
Lie covered close, and berry-bearing thorns<br />
That feed the thrush (whatever some suppose),<br />
Afford the smaller minstrel no supply.<br />
The long-protracted rigour of the year<br />
Thins all their numerous flocks.&nbsp; In chinks and holes<br />
Ten thousand seek an unmolested end,<br />
As instinct prompts, self-buried ere they die.<br />
The very rooks and daws forsake the fields,<br />
Where neither grub nor root nor earth-nut now<br />
Repays their labour more; and perched aloft<br />
By the way-side, or stalking in the path,<br />
Lean pensioners upon the traveller&rsquo;s track,<br />
Pick up their nauseous dole, though sweet to them,<br />
Of voided pulse, or half-digested grain.<br />
The streams are lost amid the splendid blank,<br />
O&rsquo;erwhelming all distinction.&nbsp; On the flood<br />
Indurated and fixed the snowy weight<br />
Lies undissolved, while silently beneath<br />
And unperceived the current steals away;<br />
Not so where, scornful of a check, it leaps<br />
The mill-dam, dashes on the restless wheel,<br />
And wantons in the pebbly gulf below.<br />
No frost can bind it there.&nbsp; Its utmost force<br />
Can but arrest the light and smoky mist<br />
That in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide.<br />
And see where it has hung the embroidered banks<br />
With forms so various, that no powers of art,<br />
The pencil, or the pen, may trace the scene!<br />
Here glittering turrets rise, upbearing high<br />
(Fantastic misarrangement) on the roof<br />
Large growth of what may seem the sparkling trees<br />
And shrubs of fairy land.&nbsp; The crystal drops<br />
That trickle down the branches, fast congealed,<br />
Shoot into pillars of pellucid length<br />
And prop the pile they but adorned before.<br />
Here grotto within grotto safe defies<br />
The sunbeam.&nbsp; There imbossed and fretted wild,<br />
The growing wonder takes a thousand shapes<br />
Capricious, in which fancy seeks in vain<br />
The likeness of some object seen before.<br />
Thus nature works as if to mock at art,<br />
And in defiance of her rival powers;<br />
By these fortuitous and random strokes<br />
Performing such inimitable feats,<br />
As she with all her rules can never reach.<br />
Less worthy of applause though more admired,<br />
Because a novelty, the work of man,<br />
Imperial mistress of the fur-clad Russ,<br />
Thy most magnificent and mighty freak,<br />
The wonder of the North.&nbsp; No forest fell<br />
When thou wouldst build; no quarry sent its stores<br />
To enrich thy walls; but thou didst hew the floods,<br />
And make thy marble of the glassy wave.<br />
In such a palace Aristaeus found<br />
Cyrene, when he bore the plaintive tale<br />
Of his lost bees to her maternal ear.<br />
In such a palace poetry might place<br />
The armoury of winter, where his troops,<br />
The gloomy clouds, find weapons, arrowy sleet,<br />
Skin-piercing volley, blossom-bruising hail,<br />
And snow that often blinds the traveller&rsquo;s course,<br />
And wraps him in an unexpected tomb.<br />
Silently as a dream the fabric rose.<br />
No sound of hammer or of saw was there.<br />
Ice upon ice, the well-adjusted parts<br />
Were soon conjoined, nor other cement asked<br />
Than water interfused to make them one.<br />
Lamps gracefully disposed, and of all hues,<br />
Illumined every side.&nbsp; A watery light<br />
Gleamed through the clear transparency, that seemed<br />
Another moon new-risen, or meteor fallen<br />
From heaven to earth, of lambent flame serene.<br />
So stood the brittle prodigy, though smooth<br />
And slippery the materials, yet frost-bound<br />
Firm as a rock.&nbsp; Nor wanted aught within<br />
That royal residence might well befit,<br />
For grandeur or for use.&nbsp; Long wavy wreaths<br />
Of flowers, that feared no enemy but warmth,<br />
Blushed on the panels.&nbsp; Mirror needed none<br />
Where all was vitreous, but in order due<br />
Convivial table and commodious seat<br />
(What seemed at least commodious seat) were there,<br />
Sofa and couch and high-built throne august.<br />
The same lubricity was found in all,<br />
And all was moist to the warm touch; a scene<br />
Of evanescent glory, once a stream,<br />
And soon to slide into a stream again.<br />
Alas, &rsquo;twas but a mortifying stroke<br />
Of undesigned severity, that glanced<br />
(Made by a monarch) on her own estate,<br />
On human grandeur and the courts of kings<br />
&rsquo;Twas transient in its nature, as in show<br />
&rsquo;Twas durable; as worthless, as it seemed<br />
Intrinsically precious; to the foot<br />
Treacherous and false; it smiled, and it was cold.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great princes have great
playthings.&nbsp; Some have played<br />
At hewing mountains into men, and some<br />
At building human wonders mountain high.<br />
Some have amused the dull sad years of life<br />
(Life spent in indolence, and therefore sad)<br />
With schemes of monumental fame, and sought<br />
By pyramids and mausoleum pomp,<br />
Short-lived themselves, to immortalise their bones.<br />
Some seek diversion in the tented field,<br />
And make the sorrows of mankind their sport.<br />
But war&rsquo;s a game which, were their subjects wise,<br />
Kings should not play at.&nbsp; Nations would do well<br />
To extort their truncheons from the puny hands<br />
Of heroes whose infirm and baby minds<br />
Are gratified with mischief, and who spoil,<br />
Because men suffer it, their toy the world.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Babel was confounded,
and the great<br />
Confederacy of projectors wild and vain<br />
Was split into diversity of tongues,<br />
Then, as a shepherd separates his flock,<br />
These to the upland, to the valley those,<br />
God drave asunder and assigned their lot<br />
To all the nations.&nbsp; Ample was the boon<br />
He gave them, in its distribution fair<br />
And equal, and he bade them dwell in peace.<br />
Peace was a while their care.&nbsp; They ploughed and sowed,<br
/>
And reaped their plenty without grudge or strife,<br />
But violence can never longer sleep<br />
Than human passions please.&nbsp; In every heart<br />
Are sown the sparks that kindle fiery war,<br />
Occasion needs but fan them, and they blaze.<br />
Cain had already shed a brother&rsquo;s blood:<br />
The Deluge washed it out; but left unquenched<br />
The seeds of murder in the breast of man.<br />
Soon, by a righteous judgment, in the line<br />
Of his descending progeny was found<br />
The first artificer of death; the shrewd<br />
Contriver who first sweated at the forge,<br />
And forced the blunt and yet unblooded steel<br />
To a keen edge, and made it bright for war.<br />
Him Tubal named, the Vulcan of old times,<br />
The sword and falchion their inventor claim,<br />
And the first smith was the first murderer&rsquo;s son.<br />
His art survived the waters; and ere long,<br />
When man was multiplied and spread abroad<br />
In tribes and clans, and had begun to call<br />
These meadows and that range of hills his own,<br />
The tasted sweets of property begat<br />
Desire of more; and industry in some<br />
To improve and cultivate their just demesne,<br />
Made others covet what they saw so fair.<br />
Thus wars began on earth.&nbsp; These fought for spoil,<br />
And those in self-defence.&nbsp; Savage at first<br />
The onset, and irregular.&nbsp; At length<br />
One eminent above the rest, for strength,<br />
For stratagem, or courage, or for all,<br />
Was chosen leader.&nbsp; Him they served in war,<br />
And him in peace for sake of warlike deeds<br />
Reverenced no less.&nbsp; Who could with him compare?<br />
Or who so worthy to control themselves<br />
As he, whose prowess had subdued their foes?<br />
Thus war, affording field for the display<br />
Of virtue, made one chief, whom times of peace,<br />
Which have their exigencies too, and call<br />
For skill in government, at length made king.<br />
King was a name too proud for man to wear<br />
With modesty and meekness, and the crown,<br />
So dazzling in their eyes who set it on,<br />
Was sure to intoxicate the brows it bound.<br />
It is the abject property of most,<br />
That being parcel of the common mass,<br />
And destitute of means to raise themselves,<br />
They sink and settle lower than they need.<br />
They know not what it is to feel within<br />
A comprehensive faculty, that grasps<br />
Great purposes with ease, that turns and wields,<br />
Almost without an effort, plans too vast<br />
For their conception, which they cannot move.<br />
Conscious of impotence they soon grow drunk<br />
With gazing, when they see an able man<br />
Step forth to notice; and besotted thus<br />
Build him a pedestal and say&mdash;Stand there,<br />
And be our admiration and our praise.<br />
They roll themselves before him in the dust,<br />
Then most deserving in their own account<br />
When most extravagant in his applause,<br />
As if exalting him they raised themselves.<br />
Thus by degrees, self-cheated of their sound<br />
And sober judgment that he is but man,<br />
They demi-deify and fume him so<br />
That in due season he forgets it too.<br />
Inflated and astrut with self-conceit<br />
He gulps the windy diet, and ere long,<br />
Adopting their mistake, profoundly thinks<br />
The world was made in vain if not for him.<br />
Thenceforth they are his cattle: drudges, born<br />
To bear his burdens, drawing in his gears,<br />
And sweating in his service.&nbsp; His caprice<br />
Becomes the soul that animates them all.<br />
He deems a thousand, or ten thousand lives,<br />
Spent in the purchase of renown for him<br />
An easy reckoning, and they think the same.<br />
Thus kings were first invented, and thus kings<br />
Were burnished into heroes, and became<br />
The arbiters of this terraqueous swamp;<br />
Storks among frogs, that have but croaked and died.<br />
Strange that such folly, as lifts bloated man<br />
To eminence fit only for a god,<br />
Should ever drivel out of human lips,<br />
Even in the cradled weakness of the world!<br />
Still stranger much, that when at length mankind<br />
Had reached the sinewy firmness of their youth,<br />
And could discriminate and argue well<br />
On subjects more mysterious, they were yet<br />
Babes in the cause of freedom, and should fear<br />
And quake before the gods themselves had made.<br />
But above measure strange, that neither proof<br />
Of sad experience, nor examples set<br />
By some whose patriot virtue has prevailed,<br />
Can even now, when they are grown mature<br />
In wisdom, and with philosophic deeps<br />
Familiar, serve to emancipate the rest!<br />
Such dupes are men to custom, and so prone<br />
To reverence what is ancient, and can plead<br />
A course of long observance for its use,<br />
That even servitude, the worst of ills,<br />
Because delivered down from sire to son,<br />
Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing.<br />
But is it fit, or can it bear the shock<br />
Of rational discussion, that a man,<br />
Compounded and made up like other men<br />
Of elements tumultuous, in whom lust<br />
And folly in as ample measure meet,<br />
As in the bosoms of the slaves he rules,<br />
Should be a despot absolute, and boast<br />
Himself the only freeman of his land?<br />
Should when he pleases, and on whom he will,<br />
Wage war, with any or with no pretence<br />
Of provocation given, or wrong sustained,<br />
And force the beggarly last doit, by means<br />
That his own humour dictates, from the clutch<br />
Of poverty, that thus he may procure<br />
His thousands, weary of penurious life,<br />
A splendid opportunity to die?<br />
Say ye, who (with less prudence than of old<br />
Jotham ascribed to his assembled trees<br />
In politic convention) put your trust<br />
I&rsquo; th&rsquo; shadow of a bramble, and recline<br />
In fancied peace beneath his dangerous branch,<br />
Rejoice in him and celebrate his sway,<br />
Where find ye passive fortitude?&nbsp; Whence springs<br />
Your self-denying zeal that holds it good<br />
To stroke the prickly grievance, and to hang<br />
His thorns with streamers of continual praise?<br />
We too are friends to loyalty; we love<br />
The king who loves the law, respects his bounds.<br />
And reigns content within them; him we serve<br />
Freely and with delight, who leaves us free;<br />
But recollecting still that he is man,<br />
We trust him not too far.&nbsp; King though he be,<br />
And king in England, too, he may be weak<br />
And vain enough to be ambitious still,<br />
May exercise amiss his proper powers,<br />
Or covet more than freemen choose to grant:<br />
Beyond that mark is treason.&nbsp; He is ours,<br />
To administer, to guard, to adorn the state,<br />
But not to warp or change it.&nbsp; We are his,<br />
To serve him nobly in the common cause<br />
True to the death, but not to be his slaves.<br />
Mark now the difference, ye that boast your love<br />
Of kings, between your loyalty and ours.<br />
We love the man; the paltry pageant you:<br />
We the chief patron of the commonwealth;<br />
You the regardless author of its woes:<br />
We, for the sake of liberty, a king;<br />
You chains and bondage for a tyrant&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p class="poetry">Our love is principle, and has its root<br />
In reason, is judicious, manly, free;<br />
Yours, a blind instinct, crouches to the rod,<br />
And licks the foot that treads it in the dust.<br />
Were kingship as true treasure as it seems,<br />
Sterling, and worthy of a wise man&rsquo;s wish,<br />
I would not be a king to be beloved<br />
Causeless, and daubed with undiscerning praise,<br />
Where love is more attachment to the throne,<br />
Not to the man who fills it as he ought.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose freedom is by
sufferance, and at will<br />
Of a superior, he is never free.<br />
Who lives, and is not weary of a life<br />
Exposed to manacles, deserves them well.<br />
The state that strives for liberty, though foiled<br />
And forced to abandon what she bravely sought,<br />
Deserves at least applause for her attempt,<br />
And pity for her loss.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s a cause<br />
Not often unsuccessful; power usurped<br />
Is weakness when opposed; conscious of wrong,<br />
&rsquo;Tis pusillanimous and prone to flight.<br />
But slaves that once conceive the glowing thought<br />
Of freedom, in that hope itself possess<br />
All that the contest calls for; spirit, strength,<br />
The scorn of danger, and united hearts,<br />
The surest presage of the good they seek. <a

&nbsp;&nbsp; Then shame to manhood, and opprobrious more<br />
To France than all her losses and defeats,<br />
Old or of later date, by sea or land,<br />
Her house of bondage worse than that of old<br />
Which God avenged on Pharaoh&mdash;the Bastille!<br />
Ye horrid towers, the abode of broken hearts,<br />
Ye dungeons and ye cages of despair,<br />
That monarchs have supplied from age to age<br />
With music such as suits their sovereign ears,<br />
The sighs and groans of miserable men!<br />
There&rsquo;s not an English heart that would not leap<br />
To hear that ye were fallen at last, to know<br />
That even our enemies, so oft employed<br />
In forging chains for us, themselves were free.<br />
For he that values liberty, confines<br />
His zeal for her predominance within<br />
No narrow bounds; her cause engages him<br />
Wherever pleaded.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the cause of man.<br />
There dwell the most forlorn of humankind,<br />
Immured though unaccused, condemned untried,<br />
Cruelly spared, and hopeless of escape.<br />
There, like the visionary emblem seen<br />
By him of Babylon, life stands a stump,<br />
And filleted about with hoops of brass,<br />
Still lives, though all its pleasant boughs are gone.<br />
To count the hour bell and expect no change;<br />
And ever as the sullen sound is heard,<br />
Still to reflect that though a joyless note<br />
To him whose moments all have one dull pace,<br />
Ten thousand rovers in the world at large<br />
Account it music; that it summons some<br />
To theatre, or jocund feast, or ball;<br />
The wearied hireling finds it a release<br />
From labour, and the lover, that has chid<br />
Its long delay, feels every welcome stroke<br />
Upon his heart-strings trembling with delight;&mdash;<br />
To fly for refuge from distracting thought<br />
To such amusements as ingenious woe<br />
Contrives, hard-shifting and without her tools;&mdash;<br />
To read engraven on the mouldy walls,<br />
In staggering types, his predecessor&rsquo;s tale,<br />
A sad memorial, and subjoin his own;&mdash;<br />
To turn purveyor to an overgorged<br />
And bloated spider, till the pampered pest<br />
Is made familiar, watches his approach,<br />
Comes at his call, and serves him for a friend;&mdash;<br />
To wear out time in numbering to and fro<br />
The studs that thick emboss his iron door,<br />
Then downward and then upward, then aslant<br />
And then alternate, with a sickly hope<br />
By dint of change to give his tasteless task<br />
Some relish, till the sum, exactly found<br />
In all directions, he begins again:&mdash;<br />
Oh comfortless existence! hemmed around<br />
With woes, which who that suffers would not kneel<br />
And beg for exile, or the pangs of death?<br />
That man should thus encroach on fellow-man,<br />
Abridge him of his just and native rights,<br />
Eradicate him, tear him from his hold<br />
Upon the endearments of domestic life<br />
And social, nip his fruitfulness and use,<br />
And doom him for perhaps a heedless word<br />
To barrenness and solitude and tears,<br />
Moves indignation; makes the name of king<br />
(Of king whom such prerogative can please)<br />
As dreadful as the Manichean god,<br />
Adored through fear, strong only to destroy.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis liberty alone that
gives the flower<br />
Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume,<br />
And we are weeds without it.&nbsp; All constraint,<br />
Except what wisdom lays on evil men,<br />
Is evil; hurts the faculties, impedes<br />
Their progress in the road of science; blinds<br />
The eyesight of discovery, and begets,<br />
In those that suffer it, a sordid mind<br />
Bestial, a meagre intellect, unfit<br />
To be the tenant of man&rsquo;s noble form.<br />
Thee therefore still, blameworthy as thou art,<br />
With all thy loss of empire, and though squeezed<br />
By public exigence, till annual food<br />
Fails for the craving hunger of the state,<br />
Thee I account still happy, and the chief<br />
Among the nations, seeing thou art free,<br />
My native nook of earth!&nbsp; Thy clime is rude,<br />
Replete with vapours, and disposes much<br />
All hearts to sadness, and none more than mine;<br />
Thine unadulterate manners are less soft<br />
And plausible than social life requires.<br />
And thou hast need of discipline and art<br />
To give thee what politer France receives<br />
From Nature&rsquo;s bounty&mdash;that humane address<br />
And sweetness, without which no pleasure is<br />
In converse, either starved by cold reserve,<br />
Or flushed with fierce dispute, a senseless brawl;<br />
Yet, being free, I love thee; for the sake<br />
Of that one feature, can be well content,<br />
Disgraced as thou hast been, poor as thou art,<br />
To seek no sublunary rest beside.<br />
But once enslaved, farewell! I could endure<br />
Chains nowhere patiently; and chains at home,<br />
Where I am free by birthright, not at all.<br />
Then what were left of roughness in the grain<br />
Of British natures, wanting its excuse<br />
That it belongs to freemen, would disgust<br />
And shock me.&nbsp; I should then with double pain<br />
Feel all the rigour of thy fickle clime;<br />
And, if I must bewail the blessing lost<br />
For which our Hampdens and our Sidneys bled,<br />
I would at least bewail it under skies<br />
Milder, among a people less austere,<br />
In scenes which, having never known me free,<br />
Would not reproach me with the loss I felt.<br />
Do I forebode impossible events,<br />
And tremble at vain dreams?&nbsp; Heaven grant I may,<br />
But the age of virtuous politics is past,<br />
And we are deep in that of cold pretence.<br />
Patriots are grown too shrewd to be sincere,<br />
And we too wise to trust them.&nbsp; He that takes<br />
Deep in his soft credulity the stamp<br />
Designed by loud declaimers on the part<br />
Of liberty, themselves the slaves of lust,<br />
Incurs derision for his easy faith<br />
And lack of knowledge, and with cause enough.<br />
For when was public virtue to be found,<br />
Where private was not?&nbsp; Can he love the whole<br />
Who loves no part? he be a nation&rsquo;s friend<br />
Who is, in truth, the friend of no man there?<br />
Can he be strenuous in his country&rsquo;s cause,<br />
Who slights the charities for whose dear sake<br />
That country, if at all, must be beloved?<br />
&mdash;&rsquo;Tis therefore sober and good men are sad<br />
For England&rsquo;s glory, seeing it wax pale<br />
And sickly, while her champions wear their hearts<br />
So loose to private duty, that no brain,<br />
Healthful and undisturbed by factious fumes,<br />
Can dream them trusty to the general weal.<br />
Such were not they of old whose tempered blades<br />
Dispersed the shackles of usurped control,<br />
And hewed them link from link.&nbsp; Then Albion&rsquo;s sons<br
/>
Were sons indeed.&nbsp; They felt a filial heart<br />
Beat high within them at a mother&rsquo;s wrongs,<br />
And shining each in his domestic sphere,<br />
Shone brighter still once called to public view.<br />
&rsquo;Tis therefore many, whose sequestered lot<br />
Forbids their interference, looking on,<br />
Anticipate perforce some dire event;<br />
And seeing the old castle of the state,<br />
That promised once more firmness, so assailed<br />
That all its tempest-beaten turrets shake,<br />
Stand motionless expectants of its fall.<br />
All has its date below.&nbsp; The fatal hour<br />
Was registered in heaven ere time began.<br />
We turn to dust, and all our mightiest works<br />
Die too.&nbsp; The deep foundations that we lay,<br />
Time ploughs them up, and not a trace remains.<br />
We build with what we deem eternal rock;<br />
A distant age asks where the fabric stood;<br />
And in the dust, sifted and searched in vain,<br />
The undiscoverable secret sleeps.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is yet a liberty
unsung<br />
By poets, and by senators unpraised,<br />
Which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the power<br />
Of earth and hell confederate take away;<br />
A liberty, which persecution, fraud,<br />
Oppression, prisons, have no power to bind,<br />
Which whoso tastes can be enslaved no more:<br />
&rsquo;Tis liberty of heart, derived from heaven,<br />
Bought with His blood who gave it to mankind,<br />
And sealed with the same token.&nbsp; It is held<br />
By charter, and that charter sanctioned sure<br />
By the unimpeachable and awful oath<br />
And promise of a God.&nbsp; His other gifts<br />
All bear the royal stamp that speaks them His,<br />
And are august, but this transcends them all.<br />
His other works, this visible display<br />
Of all-creating energy and might,<br />
Are grand, no doubt, and worthy of the Word<br />
That, finding an interminable space<br />
Unoccupied, has filled the void so well,<br />
And made so sparkling what was dark before.<br />
But these are not His glory.&nbsp; Man, &rsquo;tis true,<br />
Smit with the beauty of so fair a scene,<br />
Might well suppose the Artificer Divine<br />
Meant it eternal, had He not Himself<br />
Pronounced it transient, glorious as it is,<br />
And still designing a more glorious far,<br />
Doomed it, as insufficient for His praise.<br />
These, therefore, are occasional, and pass;<br />
Formed for the confutation of the fool<br />
Whose lying heart disputes against a God;<br />
That office served, they must be swept away.<br />
Not so the labours of His love; they shine<br />
In other heavens than these that we behold,<br />
And fade not.&nbsp; There is Paradise that fears<br />
No forfeiture, and of its fruits He sends<br />
Large prelibation oft to saints below.<br />
Of these the first in order, and the pledge<br />
And confident assurance of the rest,<br />
Is liberty; a flight into His arms<br />
Ere yet mortality&rsquo;s fine threads give way,<br />
A clear escape from tyrannising lust,<br />
And fill immunity from penal woe.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chains are the portion of
revolted man,<br />
Stripes and a dungeon; and his body serves<br />
The triple purpose.&nbsp; In that sickly, foul,<br />
Opprobrious residence, he finds them all.<br />
Propense his heart to idols, he is held<br />
In silly dotage on created things<br />
Careless of their Creator.&nbsp; And that low<br />
And sordid gravitation of his powers<br />
To a vile clod, so draws him with such force<br />
Resistless from the centre he should seek,<br />
That he at last forgets it.&nbsp; All his hopes<br />
Tend downward, his ambition is to sink,<br />
To reach a depth profounder still, and still<br />
Profounder, in the fathomless abyss<br />
Of folly, plunging in pursuit of death.<br />
But ere he gain the comfortless repose<br />
He seeks, and acquiescence of his soul,<br />
In heaven renouncing exile, he endures<br />
What does he not? from lusts opposed in vain,<br />
And self-reproaching conscience.&nbsp; He foresees<br />
The fatal issue to his health, fame, peace,<br />
Fortune, and dignity; the loss of all<br />
That can ennoble man, and make frail life,<br />
Short as it is, supportable.&nbsp; Still worse,<br />
Far worse than all the plagues with which his sins<br />
Infect his happiest moments, he forebodes<br />
Ages of hopeless misery; future death,<br />
And death still future; not a hasty stroke,<br />
Like that which sends him to the dusty grave,<br />
But unrepealable enduring death.<br />
Scripture is still a trumpet to his fears:<br />
What none can prove a forgery, may be true;<br />
What none but bad men wish exploded, must.<br />
That scruple checks him.&nbsp; Riot is not loud<br />
Nor drunk enough to drown it.&nbsp; In the midst<br />
Of laughter his compunctions are sincere,<br />
And he abhors the jest by which he shines.<br />
Remorse begets reform.&nbsp; His master-lust<br />
Falls first before his resolute rebuke,<br />
And seems dethroned and vanquished.&nbsp; Peace ensues,<br />
But spurious and short-lived, the puny child<br />
Of self-congratulating Pride, begot<br />
On fancied Innocence.&nbsp; Again he falls,<br />
And fights again; but finds his best essay,<br />
A presage ominous, portending still<br />
Its own dishonour by a worse relapse,<br />
Till Nature, unavailing Nature, foiled<br />
So oft, and wearied in the vain attempt,<br />
Scoffs at her own performance.&nbsp; Reason now<br />
Takes part with appetite, and pleads the cause,<br />
Perversely, which of late she so condemned;<br />
With shallow shifts and old devices, worn<br />
And tattered in the service of debauch,<br />
Covering his shame from his offended sight.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hath God indeed given
appetites to man,<br />
And stored the earth so plenteously with means<br />
To gratify the hunger of His wish,<br />
And doth He reprobate and will He damn<br />
The use of His own bounty? making first<br />
So frail a kind, and then enacting laws<br />
So strict, that less than perfect must despair?<br />
Falsehood! which whoso but suspects of truth,<br />
Dishonours God, and makes a slave of man.<br />
Do they themselves, who undertake for hire<br />
The teacher&rsquo;s office, and dispense at large<br />
Their weekly dole of edifying strains,<br />
Attend to their own music? have they faith<br />
In what, with such solemnity of tone<br />
And gesture, they propound to our belief?<br />
Nay&mdash;conduct hath the loudest tongue.&nbsp; The voice<br />
Is but an instrument on which the priest<br />
May play what tune he pleases.&nbsp; In the deed,<br />
The unequivocal authentic deed,<br />
We find sound argument, we read the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such reasonings (if that name
must needs belong<br />
To excuses in which reason has no part)<br />
Serve to compose a spirit well inclined<br />
To live on terms of amity with vice,<br />
And sin without disturbance.&nbsp; Often urged<br />
(As often as, libidinous discourse<br />
Exhausted, he resorts to solemn themes<br />
Of theological and grave import),<br />
They gain at last his unreserved assent,<br />
Till, hardened his heart&rsquo;s temper in the forge<br />
Of lust and on the anvil of despair,<br />
He slights the strokes of conscience.&nbsp; Nothing moves,<br />
Or nothing much, his constancy in ill;<br />
Vain tampering has but fostered his disease,<br />
&rsquo;Tis desperate, and he sleeps the sleep of death.<br />
Haste now, philosopher, and set him free.<br />
Charm the deaf serpent wisely.&nbsp; Make him hear<br />
Of rectitude and fitness: moral truth<br />
How lovely, and the moral sense how sure,<br />
Consulted and obeyed, to guide his steps<br />
Directly to the <span class="GutSmall">FIRST AND ONLY
FAIR</span>.<br />
Spare not in such a cause.&nbsp; Spend all the powers<br />
Of rant and rhapsody in virtue&rsquo;s praise,<br />
Be most sublimely good, verbosely grand,<br />
And with poetic trappings grace thy prose<br />
Till it outmantle all the pride of verse.&mdash;<br />
Ah, tinkling cymbal and high-sounding brass<br />
Smitten in vain! such music cannot charm<br />
The eclipse that intercepts truth&rsquo;s heavenly beam,<br />
And chills and darkens a wide-wandering soul.<br />
The still small voice is wanted.&nbsp; He must speak,<br />
Whose word leaps forth at once to its effect,<br />
Who calls for things that are not, and they come.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace makes the slave a
freeman.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a change<br />
That turns to ridicule the turgid speech<br />
And stately tone of moralists, who boast,<br />
As if, like him of fabulous renown,<br />
They had indeed ability to smooth<br />
The shag of savage nature, and were each<br />
An Orpheus and omnipotent in song.<br />
But transformation of apostate man<br />
From fool to wise, from earthly to divine,<br />
Is work for Him that made him.&nbsp; He alone,<br />
And He, by means in philosophic eyes<br />
Trivial and worthy of disdain, achieves<br />
The wonder; humanising what is brute<br />
In the lost kind, extracting from the lips<br />
Of asps their venom, overpowering strength<br />
By weakness, and hostility by love.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patriots have toiled, and in
their country&rsquo;s cause<br />
Bled nobly, and their deeds, as they deserve,<br />
Receive proud recompense.&nbsp; We give in charge<br />
Their names to the sweet lyre.&nbsp; The historic muse,<br />
Proud of the treasure, marches with it down<br />
To latest times; and sculpture, in her turn,<br />
Gives bond in stone and ever-during brass,<br />
To guard them, and to immortalise her trust.<br />
But fairer wreaths are due, though never paid,<br />
To those who, posted at the shrine of truth,<br />
Have fallen in her defence.&nbsp; A patriot&rsquo;s blood<br />
Well spent in such a strife may earn indeed,<br />
And for a time ensure to his loved land,<br />
The sweets of liberty and equal laws;<br />
But martyrs struggle for a brighter prize,<br />
And win it with more pain.&nbsp; Their blood is shed<br />
In confirmation of the noblest claim,<br />
Our claim to feed upon immortal truth,<br />
To walk with God, to be divinely free,<br />
To soar, and to anticipate the skies!<br />
Yet few remember them.&nbsp; They lived unknown,<br />
Till persecution dragged them into fame<br />
And chased them up to heaven.&nbsp; Their ashes flew<br />
&mdash;No marble tells us whither.&nbsp; With their names<br />
No bard embalms and sanctifies his song,<br />
And history, so warm on meaner themes,<br />
Is cold on this.&nbsp; She execrates indeed<br />
The tyranny that doomed them to the fire,<br />
But gives the glorious sufferers little praise.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the freeman whom the
truth makes free,<br />
And all are slaves beside.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a chain<br />
That hellish foes confederate for his harm<br />
Can wind around him, but he casts it off<br />
With as much ease as Samson his green withes.<br />
He looks abroad into the varied field<br />
Of Nature, and, though poor perhaps compared<br />
With those whose mansions glitter in his sight,<br />
Calls the delightful scenery all his own.<br />
His are the mountains, and the valleys his,<br />
And the resplendent river&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His to enjoy<br />
With a propriety that none can feel,<br />
But who, with filial confidence inspired,<br />
Can lift to heaven an unpresumptuous eye,<br />
And smiling say&mdash;My Father made them all!<br />
Are they not his by a peculiar right,<br />
And by an emphasis of interest his,<br />
Whose eye they fill with tears of holy joy,<br />
Whose heart with praise, and whose exalted mind<br />
With worthy thoughts of that unwearied love<br />
That planned, and built, and still upholds a world<br />
So clothed with beauty, for rebellious man?<br />
Yes&mdash;ye may fill your garners, ye that reap<br />
The loaded soil, and ye may waste much good<br />
In senseless riot; but ye will not find<br />
In feast or in the chase, in song or dance,<br />
A liberty like his, who, unimpeached<br />
Of usurpation, and to no man&rsquo;s wrong,<br />
Appropriates nature as his Father&rsquo;s work,<br />
And has a richer use of yours, than you.<br />
He is indeed a freeman.&nbsp; Free by birth<br />
Of no mean city, planned or e&rsquo;er the hills<br />
Were built, the fountains opened, or the sea<br />
With all his roaring multitude of waves.<br />
His freedom is the same in every state;<br />
And no condition of this changeful life<br />
So manifold in cares, whose every day<br />
Brings its own evil with it, makes it less.<br />
For he has wings that neither sickness, pain,<br />
Nor penury, can cripple or confine.<br />
No nook so narrow but he spreads them there<br />
With ease, and is at large.&nbsp; The oppressor holds<br />
His body bound, but knows not what a range<br />
His spirit takes, unconscious of a chain;<br />
And that to bind him is a vain attempt,<br />
Whom God delights in, and in whom He dwells.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquaint thyself with God if
thou wouldst taste<br />
His works.&nbsp; Admitted once to His embrace,<br />
Thou shalt perceive that thou wast blind before;<br />
Thine eye shall be instructed, and thine heart,<br />
Made pure, shall relish, with divine delight<br />
Till then unfelt, what hands divine have wrought.<br />
Brutes graze the mountain-top with faces prone,<br />
And eyes intent upon the scanty herb<br />
It yields them; or, recumbent on its brow,<br />
Ruminate, heedless of the scene outspread<br />
Beneath, beyond, and stretching far away<br />
From inland regions to the distant main.<br />
Man views it and admires, but rests content<br />
With what he views.&nbsp; The landscape has his praise,<br />
But not its Author.&nbsp; Unconcerned who formed<br />
The paradise he sees, he finds it such,<br />
And such well pleased to find it, asks no more.<br />
Not so the mind that has been touched from heaven,<br />
And in the school of sacred wisdom taught<br />
To read His wonders, in whose thought the world,<br />
Fair as it is, existed ere it was.<br />
Nor for its own sake merely, but for His<br />
Much more who fashioned it, he gives it praise;<br />
Praise that from earth resulting as it ought<br />
To earth&rsquo;s acknowledged Sovereign, finds at once<br />
Its only just proprietor in Him.<br />
The soul that sees Him, or receives sublimed<br />
New faculties or learns at least to employ<br />
More worthily the powers she owned before;<br />
Discerns in all things what, with stupid gaze<br />
Of ignorance, till then she overlooked,<br />
A ray of heavenly light gilding all forms<br />
Terrestrial, in the vast and the minute<br />
The unambiguous footsteps of the God<br />
Who gives its lustre to an insect&rsquo;s wing<br />
And wheels His throne upon the rolling worlds.<br />
Much conversant with heaven, she often holds<br />
With those fair ministers of light to man<br />
That fill the skies nightly with silent pomp<br />
Sweet conference; inquires what strains were they<br />
With which heaven rang, when every star, in haste<br />
To gratulate the new-created earth,<br />
Sent forth a voice, and all the sons of God<br />
Shouted for joy.&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me, ye shining hosts<br />
That navigate a sea that knows no storms,<br />
Beneath a vault unsullied with a cloud,<br />
If from your elevation, whence ye view<br />
Distinctly scenes invisible to man<br />
And systems of whose birth no tidings yet<br />
Have reached this nether world, ye spy a race<br />
Favoured as ours, transgressors from the womb<br />
And hasting to a grave, yet doomed to rise<br />
And to possess a brighter heaven than yours?<br />
As one who, long detained on foreign shores,<br />
Pants to return, and when he sees afar<br />
His country&rsquo;s weather-bleached and battered rocks,<br />
From the green wave emerging, darts an eye<br />
Radiant with joy towards the happy land;<br />
So I with animated hopes behold,<br />
And many an aching wish, your beamy fires,<br />
That show like beacons in the blue abyss,<br />
Ordained to guide the embodied spirit home<br />
From toilsome life to never-ending rest.<br />
Love kindles as I gaze.&nbsp; I feel desires<br />
That give assurance of their own success,<br />
And that, infused from heaven, must thither tend.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So reads he Nature whom the
lamp of truth<br />
Illuminates.&nbsp; Thy lamp, mysterious Word!<br />
Which whoso sees, no longer wanders lost<br />
With intellect bemazed in endless doubt,<br />
But runs the road of wisdom.&nbsp; Thou hast built,<br />
With means that were not till by Thee employed,<br />
Worlds that had never been, hadst Thou in strength<br />
Been less, or less benevolent than strong.<br />
They are Thy witnesses, who speak Thy power<br />
And goodness infinite, but speak in ears<br />
That hear not, or receive not their report.<br />
In vain Thy creatures testify of Thee<br />
Till Thou proclaim Thyself.&nbsp; Theirs is indeed<br />
A teaching voice; but &rsquo;tis the praise of Thine<br />
That whom it teaches it makes prompt to learn,<br />
And with the boon gives talents for its use.<br />
Till Thou art heard, imaginations vain<br />
Possess the heart, and fables, false as hell,<br />
Yet deemed oracular, lure down to death<br />
The uninformed and heedless souls of men.<br />
We give to chance, blind chance, ourselves as blind,<br />
The glory of Thy work, which yet appears<br />
Perfect and unimpeachable of blame,<br />
Challenging human scrutiny, and proved<br />
Then skilful most when most severely judged.<br />
But chance is not; or is not where Thou reign&rsquo;st:<br />
Thy providence forbids that fickle power<br />
(If power she be that works but to confound)<br />
To mix her wild vagaries with Thy laws.<br />
Yet thus we dote, refusing, while we can,<br />
Instruction, and inventing to ourselves<br />
Gods such as guilt makes welcome&mdash;gods that sleep,<br />
Or disregard our follies, or that sit<br />
Amused spectators of this bustling stage.<br />
Thee we reject, unable to abide<br />
Thy purity, till pure as Thou art pure,<br />
Made such by Thee, we love Thee for that cause<br />
For which we shunned and hated Thee before.<br />
Then we are free: then liberty, like day,<br />
Breaks on the soul, and by a flash from heaven<br />
Fires all the faculties with glorious joy.<br />
A voice is heard that mortal ears hear not<br />
Till Thou hast touched them; &rsquo;tis the voice of song,<br />
A loud Hosanna sent from all Thy works,<br />
Which he that hears it with a shout repeats,<br />
And adds his rapture to the general praise.<br />
In that blest moment, Nature, throwing wide<br />
Her veil opaque, discloses with a smile<br />
The Author of her beauties, who, retired<br />
Behind His own creation, works unseen<br />
By the impure, and hears His power denied.<br />
Thou art the source and centre of all minds,<br />
Their only point of rest, eternal Word!<br />
From Thee departing, they are lost and rove<br />
At random, without honour, hope, or peace.<br />
From Thee is all that soothes the life of man,<br />
His high endeavour, and his glad success,<br />
His strength to suffer, and his will to serve.<br />
But, oh, Thou Bounteous Giver of all good,<br />
Thou art of all Thy gifts Thyself the crown!<br />
Give what Thou canst, without Thee we are poor,<br />
And with Thee rich, take what Thou wilt away.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE WINTER WALK AT NOON.</span></h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> is in souls a
sympathy with sounds,<br />
And as the mind is pitched the ear is pleased<br />
With melting airs or martial, brisk or grave;<br />
Some chord in unison with what we hear<br />
Is touched within us, and the heart replies.<br />
How soft the music of those village bells<br />
Falling at intervals upon the ear<br />
In cadence sweet, now dying all away,<br />
Now pealing loud again, and louder still,<br />
Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on.<br />
With easy force it opens all the cells<br />
Where memory slept.&nbsp; Wherever I have heard<br />
A kindred melody, the scene recurs,<br />
And with it all its pleasures and its pains.<br />
Such comprehensive views the spirit takes,<br />
That in a few short moments I retrace<br />
(As in a map the voyager his course)<br />
The windings of my way through many years.<br />
Short as in retrospect the journey seems,<br />
It seemed not always short; the rugged path,<br />
And prospect oft so dreary and forlorn,<br />
Moved many a sigh at its disheartening length.<br />
Yet feeling present evils, while the past<br />
Faintly impress the mind, or not at all,<br />
How readily we wish time spent revoked,<br />
That we might try the ground again, where once<br />
(Through inexperience as we now perceive)<br />
We missed that happiness we might have found.<br />
Some friend is gone, perhaps his son&rsquo;s best friend<br />
A father, whose authority, in show<br />
When most severe, and mustering all its force,<br />
Was but the graver countenance of love;<br />
Whose favour, like the clouds of spring, might lower,<br />
And utter now and then an awful voice,<br />
But had a blessing in its darkest frown,<br />
Threatening at once and nourishing the plant.<br />
We loved, but not enough, the gentle hand<br />
That reared us.&nbsp; At a thoughtless age allured<br />
By every gilded folly, we renounced<br />
His sheltering side, and wilfully forewent<br />
That converse which we now in vain regret.<br />
How gladly would the man recall to life<br />
The boy&rsquo;s neglected sire! a mother too,<br />
That softer friend, perhaps more gladly still,<br />
Might he demand them at the gates of death.<br />
Sorrow has since they went subdued and tamed<br />
The playful humour; he could now endure<br />
(Himself grown sober in the vale of tears)<br />
And feel a parent&rsquo;s presence no restraint.<br />
But not to understand a treasure&rsquo;s worth<br />
Till time has stolen away the slighted good,<br />
Is cause of half the poverty we feel,<br />
And makes the world the wilderness it is.<br />
The few that pray at all, pray oft amiss,<br />
And, seeking grace to improve the prize they hold,<br />
Would urge a wiser suit than asking more.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night was winter in his
roughest mood,<br />
The morning sharp and clear; but now at noon<br />
Upon the southern side of the slant hills,<br />
And where the woods fence off the northern blast,<br />
The season smiles, resigning all its rage,<br />
And has the warmth of May.&nbsp; The vault is blue<br />
Without a cloud, and white without a speck<br />
The dazzling splendour of the scene below.<br />
Again the harmony comes o&rsquo;er the vale,<br />
And through the trees I view the embattled tower<br />
Whence all the music.&nbsp; I again perceive<br />
The soothing influence of the wafted strains,<br />
And settle in soft musings, as I tread<br />
The walk still verdant under oaks and elms,<br />
Whose outspread branches overarch the glade.<br />
The roof, though movable through all its length,<br />
As the wind sways it, has yet well sufficed,<br />
And, intercepting in their silent fall<br />
The frequent flakes, has kept a path for me.<br />
No noise is here, or none that hinders thought:<br />
The redbreast warbles still, but is content<br />
With slender notes and more than half suppressed.<br />
Pleased with his solitude, and flitting light<br />
From spray to spray, where&rsquo;er he rests he shakes<br />
From many a twig the pendant drops of ice,<br />
That tinkle in the withered leaves below.<br />
Stillness, accompanied with sounds so soft,<br />
Charms more than silence.&nbsp; Meditation here<br />
May think down hours to moments.&nbsp; Here the heart<br />
May give an useful lesson to the head,<br />
And learning wiser grow without his books.<br />
Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,<br />
Have ofttimes no connection.&nbsp; Knowledge dwells<br />
In heads replete with thoughts of other men;<br />
Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.<br />
Knowledge, a rude unprofitable mass,<br />
The mere materials with which wisdom builds,<br />
Till smoothed and squared and fitted to its place,<br />
Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich.<br />
Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much,<br />
Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.<br />
Books are not seldom talismans and spells<br />
By which the magic art of shrewder wits<br />
Holds an unthinking multitude enthralled.<br />
Some to the fascination of a name<br />
Surrender judgment hoodwinked.&nbsp; Some the style<br />
Infatuates, and, through labyrinths and wilds<br />
Of error, leads them by a tune entranced.<br />
While sloth seduces more, too weak to bear<br />
The insupportable fatigue of thought,<br />
And swallowing therefore without pause or choice<br />
The total grist unsifted, husks and all.<br />
But trees, and rivulets whose rapid course<br />
Defies the check of winter, haunts of deer,<br />
And sheep-walks populous with bleating lambs,<br />
And lanes, in which the primrose ere her time<br />
Peeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root,<br />
Deceive no student.&nbsp; Wisdom there, and truth,<br />
Not shy as in the world, and to be won<br />
By slow solicitation, seize at once<br />
The roving thought, and fix it on themselves.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What prodigies can power
divine perform<br />
More grand than it produces year by year,<br />
And all in sight of inattentive man?<br />
Familiar with the effect we slight the cause,<br />
And in the constancy of Nature&rsquo;s course,<br />
The regular return of genial months,<br />
And renovation of a faded world,<br />
See nought to wonder at.&nbsp; Should God again,<br />
As once in Gibeon, interrupt the race<br />
Of the undeviating and punctual sun,<br />
How would the world admire! but speaks it less<br />
An agency divine, to make him know<br />
His moment when to sink and when to rise<br />
Age after age, than to arrest his course?<br />
All we behold is miracle: but, seen<br />
So duly, all is miracle in vain.<br />
Where now the vital energy that moved,<br />
While summer was, the pure and subtle lymph<br />
Through the imperceptible meandering veins<br />
Of leaf and flower?&nbsp; It sleeps: and the icy touch<br />
Of unprolific winter has impressed<br />
A cold stagnation on the intestine tide.<br />
But let the months go round, a few short months,<br />
And all shall be restored.&nbsp; These naked shoots,<br />
Barren as lances, among which the wind<br />
Makes wintry music, sighing as it goes,<br />
Shall put their graceful foliage on again,<br />
And more aspiring and with ampler spread<br />
Shall boast new charms, and more than they have lost.<br />
Then, each in its peculiar honours clad,<br />
Shall publish even to the distant eye<br />
Its family and tribe.&nbsp; Laburnum rich<br />
In streaming gold; syringa ivory pure;<br />
The scented and the scentless rose; this red<br />
And of a humbler growth, the other tall,<br />
And throwing up into the darkest gloom<br />
Of neighbouring cypress, or more sable yew,<br />
Her silver globes, light as the foamy surf<br />
That the wind severs from the broken wave;<br />
The lilac various in array, now white,<br />
Now sanguine, and her beauteous head now set<br />
With purple spikes pyramidal, as if<br />
Studious of ornament, yet unresolved<br />
Which hue she most approved, she chose them all;<br />
Copious of flowers the woodbine, pale and wan,<br />
But well compensating their sickly looks<br />
With never-cloying odours, early and late;<br />
Hypericum all bloom, so thick a swarm<br />
Of flowers like flies, clothing her slender rods,<br />
That scarce a leaf appears; mezereon too,<br />
Though leafless, well attired, and thick beset<br />
With blushing wreaths investing every spray;<br />
Alth&aelig;a with the purple eye; the broom,<br />
Yellow and bright as bullion unalloyed<br />
Her blossoms; and luxuriant above all<br />
The jasmine, throwing wide her elegant sweets,<br />
The deep dark green of whose unvarnished leaf<br />
Makes more conspicuous, and illumines more<br />
The bright profusion of her scattered stars.&mdash;<br />
These have been, and these shall be in their day,<br />
And all this uniform uncoloured scene<br />
Shall be dismantled of its fleecy load,<br />
And flush into variety again.<br />
From dearth to plenty, and from death to life,<br />
Is Nature&rsquo;s progress when she lectures man<br />
In heavenly truth; evincing, as she makes<br />
The grand transition, that there lives and works<br />
A soul in all things, and that soul is God.<br />
The beauties of the wilderness are His,<br />
That make so gay the solitary place<br />
Where no eye sees them.&nbsp; And the fairer forms<br />
That cultivation glories in, are His.<br />
He sets the bright procession on its way,<br />
And marshals all the order of the year.<br />
He marks the bounds which Winter may not pass,<br />
And blunts his pointed fury.&nbsp; In its case,<br />
Russet and rude, folds up the tender germ<br />
Uninjured, with inimitable art,<br />
And, ere one flowery season fades and dies,<br />
Designs the blooming wonders of the next.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say that in the origin
of things,<br />
When all creation started into birth,<br />
The infant elements received a law<br />
From which they swerve not since; that under force<br />
Of that controlling ordinance they move,<br />
And need not His immediate hand, who first<br />
Prescribed their course, to regulate it now.<br />
Thus dream they, and contrive to save a God<br />
The encumbrance of His own concerns, and spare<br />
The great Artificer of all that moves<br />
The stress of a continual act, the pain<br />
Of unremitted vigilance and care,<br />
As too laborious and severe a task.<br />
So man the moth is not afraid, it seems,<br />
To span Omnipotence, and measure might<br />
That knows no measure, by the scanty rule<br />
And standard of his own, that is to-day,<br />
And is not ere to-morrow&rsquo;s sun go down.<br />
But how should matter occupy a charge<br />
Dull as it is, and satisfy a law<br />
So vast in its demands, unless impelled<br />
To ceaseless service by a ceaseless force,<br />
And under pressure of some conscious cause?<br />
The Lord of all, Himself through all diffused<br />
Sustains and is the life of all that lives.<br />
Nature is but a name for an effect<br />
Whose cause is God.&nbsp; He feeds the secret fire<br />
By which the mighty process is maintained,<br />
Who sleeps not, is not weary; in whose sight<br />
Slow-circling ages are as transient days;<br />
Whose work is without labour, whose designs<br />
No flaw deforms, no difficulty thwarts,<br />
And whose beneficence no charge exhausts.<br />
Him blind antiquity profaned, not served,<br />
With self-taught rites and under various names<br />
Female and male, Pomona, Pales, Pan,<br />
And Flora and Vertumnus; peopling earth<br />
With tutelary goddesses and gods<br />
That were not, and commending as they would<br />
To each some province, garden, field, or grove.<br />
But all are under One.&nbsp; One spirit&mdash;His<br />
Who bore the platted thorns with bleeding brows&mdash;<br />
Rules universal nature.&nbsp; Not a flower<br />
But shows some touch in freckle, streak, or stain,<br />
Of His unrivalled pencil.&nbsp; He inspires<br />
Their balmy odours and imparts their hues,<br />
And bathes their eyes with nectar, and includes,<br />
In grains as countless as the sea-side sands,<br />
The forms with which He sprinkles all the earth.<br />
Happy who walks with Him! whom, what he finds<br />
Of flavour or of scent in fruit or flower,<br />
Or what he views of beautiful or grand<br />
In nature, from the broad majestic oak<br />
To the green blade that twinkles in the sun,<br />
Prompts with remembrance of a present God.<br />
His presence, who made all so fair, perceived,<br />
Makes all still fairer.&nbsp; As with Him no scene<br />
Is dreary, so with Him all seasons please.<br />
Though winter had been none had man been true,<br />
And earth be punished for its tenant&rsquo;s sake,<br />
Yet not in vengeance; as this smiling sky,<br />
So soon succeeding such an angry night,<br />
And these dissolving snows, and this clear stream,<br />
Recovering fast its liquid music, prove.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who then, that has a mind
well strung and tuned<br />
To contemplation, and within his reach<br />
A scene so friendly to his favourite task,<br />
Would waste attention at the chequered board,<br />
His host of wooden warriors to and fro<br />
Marching and counter-marching, with an eye<br />
As fixt as marble, with a forehead ridged<br />
And furrowed into storms, and with a hand<br />
Trembling, as if eternity were hung<br />
In balance on his conduct of a pin?<br />
Nor envies he aught more their idle sport,<br />
Who pant with application misapplied<br />
To trivial toys, and, pushing ivory balls<br />
Across the velvet level, feel a joy<br />
Akin to rapture, when the bauble finds<br />
Its destined goal of difficult access.<br />
Nor deems he wiser him, who gives his noon<br />
To Miss, the Mercer&rsquo;s plague, from shop to shop<br />
Wandering, and littering with unfolded silks<br />
The polished counter, and approving none,<br />
Or promising with smiles to call again.<br />
Nor him, who, by his vanity seduced,<br />
And soothed into a dream that he discerns<br />
The difference of a Guido from a daub,<br />
Frequents the crowded auction.&nbsp; Stationed there<br />
As duly as the Langford of the show,<br />
With glass at eye, and catalogue in hand,<br />
And tongue accomplished in the fulsome cant<br />
And pedantry that coxcombs learn with ease,<br />
Oft as the price-deciding hammer falls<br />
He notes it in his book, then raps his box,<br />
Swears &rsquo;tis a bargain, rails at his hard fate<br />
That he has let it pass&mdash;but never bids.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here unmolested, through
whatever sign<br />
The sun proceeds, I wander; neither mist,<br />
Nor freezing sky, nor sultry, checking me,<br />
Nor stranger intermeddling with my joy.<br />
Even in the spring and play-time of the year<br />
That calls the unwonted villager abroad<br />
With all her little ones, a sportive train,<br />
To gather king-cups in the yellow mead,<br />
And prank their hair with daisies, or to pick<br />
A cheap but wholesome salad from the brook,<br />
These shades are all my own.&nbsp; The timorous hare,<br />
Grown so familiar with her frequent guest,<br />
Scarce shuns me; and the stock-dove unalarmed<br />
Sits cooing in the pine-tree, nor suspends<br />
His long love-ditty for my near approach.<br />
Drawn from his refuge in some lonely elm<br />
That age or injury has hollowed deep,<br />
Where on his bed of wool and matted leaves<br />
He has outslept the winter, ventures forth<br />
To frisk awhile, and bask in the warm sun,<br />
The squirrel, flippant, pert, and full of play.<br />
He sees me, and at once, swift as a bird,<br />
Ascends the neighbouring beech; there whisks his brush,<br />
And perks his ears, and stamps and scolds aloud,<br />
With all the prettiness of feigned alarm,<br />
And anger insignificantly fierce.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is hard in nature,
and unfit<br />
For human fellowship, as being void<br />
Of sympathy, and therefore dead alike<br />
To love and friendship both, that is not pleased<br />
With sight of animals enjoying life,<br />
Nor feels their happiness augment his own.<br />
The bounding fawn that darts across the glade<br />
When none pursues, through mere delight of heart,<br />
And spirits buoyant with excess of glee;<br />
The horse, as wanton and almost as fleet,<br />
That skims the spacious meadow at full speed,<br />
Then stops and snorts, and throwing high his heels<br />
Starts to the voluntary race again;<br />
The very kine that gambol at high noon,<br />
The total herd receiving first from one,<br />
That leads the dance, a summons to be gay,<br />
Though wild their strange vagaries, and uncouth<br />
Their efforts, yet resolved with one consent<br />
To give such act and utterance as they may<br />
To ecstasy too big to be suppressed&mdash;<br />
These, and a thousand images of bliss,<br />
With which kind nature graces every scene<br />
Where cruel man defeats not her design,<br />
Impart to the benevolent, who wish<br />
All that are capable of pleasure pleased,<br />
A far superior happiness to theirs,<br />
The comfort of a reasonable joy.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man scarce had risen,
obedient to His call<br />
Who formed him from the dust, his future grave,<br />
When he was crowned as never king was since.<br />
God set His diadem upon his head,<br />
And angel choirs attended.&nbsp; Wondering stood<br />
The new-made monarch, while before him passed,<br />
All happy and all perfect in their kind,<br />
The creatures, summoned from their various haunts<br />
To see their sovereign, and confess his sway.<br />
Vast was his empire, absolute his power,<br />
Or bounded only by a law whose force<br />
&rsquo;Twas his sublimest privilege to feel<br />
And own, the law of universal love.<br />
He ruled with meekness, they obeyed with joy.<br />
No cruel purpose lurked within his heart,<br />
And no distrust of his intent in theirs.<br />
So Eden was a scene of harmless sport,<br />
Where kindness on his part who ruled the whole<br />
Begat a tranquil confidence in all,<br />
And fear as yet was not, nor cause for fear.<br />
But sin marred all; and the revolt of man,<br />
That source of evils not exhausted yet,<br />
Was punished with revolt of his from him.<br />
Garden of God, how terrible the change<br />
Thy groves and lawns then witnessed! every heart,<br />
Each animal of every name, conceived<br />
A jealousy and an instinctive fear,<br />
And, conscious of some danger, either fled<br />
Precipitate the loathed abode of man,<br />
Or growled defiance in such angry sort,<br />
As taught him too to tremble in his turn.<br />
Thus harmony and family accord<br />
Were driven from Paradise; and in that hour<br />
The seeds of cruelty, that since have swelled<br />
To such gigantic and enormous growth,<br />
Were sown in human nature&rsquo;s fruitful soil.<br />
Hence date the persecution and the pain<br />
That man inflicts on all inferior kinds,<br />
Regardless of their plaints.&nbsp; To make him sport,<br />
To gratify the frenzy of his wrath,<br />
Or his base gluttony, are causes good<br />
And just in his account, why bird and beast<br />
Should suffer torture, and the streams be dyed<br />
With blood of their inhabitants impaled.<br />
Earth groans beneath the burden of a war<br />
Waged with defenceless innocence, while he,<br />
Not satisfied to prey on all around,<br />
Adds tenfold bitterness to death by pangs<br />
Needless, and first torments ere he devours.<br />
Now happiest they that occupy the scenes<br />
The most remote from his abhorred resort,<br />
Whom once as delegate of God on earth<br />
They feared, and as His perfect image loved.<br />
The wilderness is theirs with all its caves,<br />
Its hollow glens, its thickets, and its plains<br />
Unvisited by man.&nbsp; There they are free,<br />
And howl and roar as likes them, uncontrolled,<br />
Nor ask his leave to slumber or to play.<br />
Woe to the tyrant, if he dare intrude<br />
Within the confines of their wild domain;<br />
The lion tells him, &ldquo;I am monarch here;&rdquo;<br />
And if he spares him, spares him on the terms<br />
Of royal mercy, and through generous scorn<br />
To rend a victim trembling at his foot.<br />
In measure, as by force of instinct drawn,<br />
Or by necessity constrained, they live<br />
Dependent upon man, those in his fields,<br />
These at his crib, and some beneath his roof;<br />
They prove too often at how dear a rate<br />
He sells protection.&nbsp; Witness, at his foot<br />
The spaniel dying for some venial fault,<br />
Under dissection of the knotted scourge;<br />
Witness the patient ox, with stripes and yells<br />
Driven to the slaughter, goaded as he runs<br />
To madness, while the savage at his heels<br />
Laughs at the frantic sufferer&rsquo;s fury spent<br />
Upon the guiltless passenger o&rsquo;erthrown.<br />
He too is witness, noblest of the train<br />
That wait on man, the flight-performing horse:<br />
With unsuspecting readiness he takes<br />
His murderer on his back, and, pushed all day,<br />
With bleeding sides, and flanks that heave for life,<br />
To the far-distant goal, arrives and dies.<br />
So little mercy shows who needs so much!<br />
Does law, so jealous in the cause of man,<br />
Denounce no doom on the delinquent?&nbsp; None.<br />
He lives, and o&rsquo;er his brimming beaker boasts<br />
(As if barbarity were high desert)<br />
The inglorious feat, and, clamorous in praise<br />
Of the poor brute, seems wisely to suppose<br />
The honours of his matchless horse his own.<br />
But many a crime, deemed innocent on earth,<br />
Is registered in heaven, and these, no doubt,<br />
Have each their record, with a curse annexed.<br />
Man may dismiss compassion from his heart,<br />
But God will never.&nbsp; When He charged the Jew<br />
To assist his foe&rsquo;s down-fallen beast to rise,<br />
And when the bush-exploring boy that seized<br />
The young, to let the parent bird go free,<br />
Proved He not plainly that His meaner works<br />
Are yet His care, and have an interest all,<br />
All, in the universal Father&rsquo;s love?<br />
On Noah, and in him on all mankind,<br />
The charter was conferred by which we hold<br />
The flesh of animals in fee, and claim,<br />
O&rsquo;er all we feed on, power of life and death.<br />
But read the instrument, and mark it well;<br />
The oppression of a tyrannous control<br />
Can find no warrant there.&nbsp; Feed then, and yield<br />
Thanks for thy food.&nbsp; Carnivorous, through sin,<br />
Feed on the slain, but spare the living brute.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor of all, Himself
to all<br />
So bountiful, in whose attentive ear<br />
The unfledged raven and the lion&rsquo;s whelp<br />
Plead not in vain for pity on the pangs<br />
Of hunger unassuaged, has interposed,<br />
Not seldom, His avenging arm, to smite<br />
The injurious trampler upon nature&rsquo;s law,<br />
That claims forbearance even for a brute.<br />
He hates the hardness of a Balaam&rsquo;s heart,<br />
And, prophet as he was, he might not strike<br />
The blameless animal, without rebuke,<br />
On which he rode.&nbsp; Her opportune offence<br />
Saved him, or the unrelenting seer had died.<br />
He sees that human equity is slack<br />
To interfere, though in so just a cause,<br />
And makes the task His own; inspiring dumb<br />
And helpless victims with a sense so keen<br />
Of injury, with such knowledge of their strength,<br />
And such sagacity to take revenge,<br />
That oft the beast has seemed to judge the man.<br />
An ancient, not a legendary tale,<br />
By one of sound intelligence rehearsed,<br />
(If such, who plead for Providence may seem<br />
In modern eyes) shall make the doctrine clear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where England, stretched
towards the setting sun,<br />
Narrow and long, o&rsquo;erlooks the western wave,<br />
Dwelt young Misagathus; a scorner he<br />
Of God and goodness, atheist in ostent,<br />
Vicious in act, in temper savage-fierce.<br />
He journeyed, and his chance was, as he went,<br />
To join a traveller of far different note&mdash;<br />
Evander, famed for piety, for years<br />
Deserving honour, but for wisdom more.<br />
Fame had not left the venerable man<br />
A stranger to the manners of the youth,<br />
Whose face, too, was familiar to his view.<br />
Their way was on the margin of the land,<br />
O&rsquo;er the green summit of the rocks whose base<br />
Beats back the roaring surge, scarce heard so high.<br />
The charity that warmed his heart was moved<br />
At sight of the man-monster.&nbsp; With a smile<br />
Gentle and affable, and full of grace,<br />
As fearful of offending whom he wished<br />
Much to persuade, he plied his ear with truths<br />
Not harshly thundered forth or rudely pressed,<br />
But, like his purpose, gracious, kind, and sweet.<br />
&ldquo;And dost thou dream,&rdquo; the impenetrable man<br />
Exclaimed, &ldquo;that me the lullabies of age,<br />
And fantasies of dotards such as thou,<br />
Can cheat, or move a moment&rsquo;s fear in me?<br />
Mark now the proof I give thee, that the brave<br />
Need no such aids as superstition lends<br />
To steel their hearts against the dread of death.&rdquo;<br />
He spoke, and to the precipice at hand<br />
Pushed with a madman&rsquo;s fury.&nbsp; Fancy shrinks,<br />
And the blood thrills and curdles at the thought<br />
Of such a gulf as he designed his grave.<br />
But though the felon on his back could dare<br />
The dreadful leap, more rational, his steed<br />
Declined the death, and wheeling swiftly round,<br />
Or ere his hoof had pressed the crumbling verge,<br />
Baffled his rider, saved against his will.<br />
The frenzy of the brain may be redressed<br />
By medicine well applied, but without grace<br />
The heart&rsquo;s insanity admits no cure.<br />
Enraged the more by what might have reformed<br />
His horrible intent, again he sought<br />
Destruction, with a zeal to be destroyed,<br />
With sounding whip and rowels dyed in blood.<br />
But still in vain.&nbsp; The Providence that meant<br />
A longer date to the far nobler beast,<br />
Spared yet again the ignobler for his sake.<br />
And now, his prowess proved, and his sincere,<br />
Incurable obduracy evinced,<br />
His rage grew cool; and, pleased perhaps to have earned<br />
So cheaply the renown of that attempt,<br />
With looks of some complacence he resumed<br />
His road, deriding much the blank amaze<br />
Of good Evander, still where he was left<br />
Fixed motionless, and petrified with dread.<br />
So on they fared; discourse on other themes<br />
Ensuing, seemed to obliterate the past,<br />
And tamer far for so much fury shown<br />
(As is the course of rash and fiery men)<br />
The rude companion smiled as if transformed.<br />
But &rsquo;twas a transient calm.&nbsp; A storm was near,<br />
An unsuspected storm.&nbsp; His hour was come.<br />
The impious challenger of power divine<br />
Was now to learn that Heaven, though slow to wrath,<br />
Is never with impunity defied.<br />
His horse, as he had caught his master&rsquo;s mood,<br />
Snorting, and starting into sudden rage,<br />
Unbidden, and not now to be controlled,<br />
Rushed to the cliff, and having reached it, stood.<br />
At once the shock unseated him; he flew<br />
Sheer o&rsquo;er the craggy barrier, and, immersed<br />
Deep in the flood, found, when he sought it not,<br />
The death he had deserved, and died alone.<br />
So God wrought double justice; made the fool<br />
The victim of his own tremendous choice,<br />
And taught a brute the way to safe revenge.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not enter on my list
of friends<br />
(Though graced with polished manners and fine sense,<br />
Yet wanting sensibility) the man<br />
Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.<br />
An inadvertent step may crush the snail<br />
That crawls at evening in the public path;<br />
But he that has humanity, forewarned,<br />
Will tread aside, and let the reptile live.<br />
The creeping vermin, loathsome to the sight,<br />
And charged perhaps with venom, that intrudes<br />
A visitor unwelcome into scenes<br />
Sacred to neatness and repose, the alcove,<br />
The chamber, or refectory, may die.<br />
A necessary act incurs no blame.<br />
Not so when, held within their proper bounds<br />
And guiltless of offence, they range the air,<br />
Or take their pastime in the spacious field.<br />
There they are privileged; and he that hunts<br />
Or harms them there is guilty of a wrong,<br />
Disturbs the economy of Nature&rsquo;s realm,<br />
Who, when she formed, designed them an abode.<br />
The sum is this: if man&rsquo;s convenience, health,<br />
Or safety interfere, his rights and claims<br />
Are paramount, and must extinguish theirs.<br />
Else they are all&mdash;the meanest things that are&mdash;<br />
As free to live and to enjoy that life,<br />
As God was free to form them at the first,<br />
Who in His sovereign wisdom made them all.<br />
Ye, therefore, who love mercy, teach your sons<br />
To love it too.&nbsp; The spring-time of our years<br />
Is soon dishonoured and defiled in most<br />
By budding ills, that ask a prudent hand<br />
To check them.&nbsp; But, alas! none sooner shoots,<br />
If unrestrained, into luxuriant growth,<br />
Than cruelty, most devilish of them all.<br />
Mercy to him that shows it, is the rule<br />
And righteous limitation of its act,<br />
By which Heaven moves in pardoning guilty man;<br />
And he that shows none, being ripe in years,<br />
And conscious of the outrage he commits,<br />
Shall seek it and not find it in his turn.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinguished much by reason,
and still more<br />
By our capacity of grace divine,<br />
From creatures that exist but for our sake,<br />
Which having served us, perish, we are held<br />
Accountable, and God, some future day,<br />
Will reckon with us roundly for the abuse<br />
Of what He deems no mean or trivial trust.<br />
Superior as we are, they yet depend<br />
Not more on human help, than we on theirs.<br />
Their strength, or speed, or vigilance, were given<br />
In aid of our defects.&nbsp; In some are found<br />
Such teachable and apprehensive parts,<br />
That man&rsquo;s attainments in his own concerns,<br />
Matched with the expertness of the brutes in theirs,<br />
Are ofttimes vanquished and thrown far behind.<br />
Some show that nice sagacity of smell,<br />
And read with such discernment, in the port<br />
And figure of the man, his secret aim,<br />
That oft we owe our safety to a skill<br />
We could not teach, and must despair to learn.<br />
But learn we might, if not too proud to stoop<br />
To quadruped instructors, many a good<br />
And useful quality, and virtue too,<br />
Rarely exemplified among ourselves;<br />
Attachment never to be weaned, or changed<br />
By any change of fortune, proof alike<br />
Against unkindness, absence, and neglect;<br />
Fidelity, that neither bribe nor threat<br />
Can move or warp; and gratitude for small<br />
And trivial favours, lasting as the life,<br />
And glistening even in the dying eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man praises man.&nbsp; Desert
in arts or arms<br />
Wins public honour; and ten thousand sit<br />
Patiently present at a sacred song,<br />
Commemoration-mad; content to hear<br />
(Oh wonderful effect of music&rsquo;s power!)<br />
Messiah&rsquo;s eulogy, for Handel&rsquo;s sake.<br />
But less, methinks, than sacrilege might serve&mdash;<br />
(For was it less?&nbsp; What heathen would have dared<br />
To strip Jove&rsquo;s statue of his oaken wreath<br />
And hang it up in honour of a man?)<br />
Much less might serve, when all that we design<br />
Is but to gratify an itching ear,<br />
And give the day to a musician&rsquo;s praise.<br />
Remember Handel! who, that was not born<br />
Deaf as the dead to harmony, forgets,<br />
Or can, the more than Homer of his age?<br />
Yes&mdash;we remember him; and, while we praise<br />
A talent so divine, remember too<br />
That His most holy Book from whom it came<br />
Was never meant, was never used before<br />
To buckram out the memory of a man.<br />
But hush!&mdash;the muse perhaps is too severe,<br />
And with a gravity beyond the size<br />
And measure of the offence, rebukes a deed<br />
Less impious than absurd, and owing more<br />
To want of judgment than to wrong design.<br />
So in the chapel of old Ely House,<br />
When wandering Charles, who meant to be the third,<br />
Had fled from William, and the news was fresh,<br />
The simple clerk, but loyal, did announce,<br />
And eke did rear right merrily, two staves,<br />
Sung to the praise and glory of King George.<br />
&mdash;Man praises man; and Garrick&rsquo;s memory next,<br />
When time has somewhat mellowed it, and made<br />
The idol of our worship while he lived<br />
The god of our idolatry once more,<br />
Shall have its altar; and the world shall go<br />
In pilgrimage to bow before his shrine.<br />
The theatre, too small, shall suffocate<br />
Its squeezed contents, and more than it admits<br />
Shall sigh at their exclusion, and return<br />
Ungratified.&nbsp; For there some noble lord<br />
Shall stuff his shoulders with King Richard&rsquo;s bunch,<br />
Or wrap himself in Hamlet&rsquo;s inky cloak,<br />
And strut, and storm, and straddle, stamp, and stare,<br />
To show the world how Garrick did not act,<br />
For Garrick was a worshipper himself;<br />
He drew the liturgy, and framed the rites<br />
And solemn ceremonial of the day,<br />
And called the world to worship on the banks<br />
Of Avon famed in song.&nbsp; Ah! pleasant proof<br />
That piety has still in human hearts<br />
Some place, a spark or two not yet extinct.<br />
The mulberry-tree was hung with blooming wreaths,<br />
The mulberry-tree stood centre of the dance,<br />
The mulberry-tree was hymned with dulcet airs,<br />
And from his touchwood trunk the mulberry-tree<br />
Supplied such relics as devotion holds<br />
Still sacred, and preserves with pious care.<br />
So &rsquo;twas a hallowed time: decorum reigned,<br />
And mirth without offence.&nbsp; No few returned<br />
Doubtless much edified, and all refreshed.<br />
&mdash;Man praises man.&nbsp; The rabble all alive,<br />
From tippling benches, cellars, stalls, and styes,<br />
Swarm in the streets.&nbsp; The statesman of the day,<br />
A pompous and slow-moving pageant, comes;<br />
Some shout him, and some hang upon his car<br />
To gaze in his eyes and bless him.&nbsp; Maidens wave<br />
Their kerchiefs, and old women weep for joy<br />
While others not so satisfied unhorse<br />
The gilded equipage, and, turning loose<br />
His steeds, usurp a place they well deserve.<br />
Why? what has charmed them?&nbsp; Hath he saved the state?<br />
No.&nbsp; Doth he purpose its salvation?&nbsp; No.<br />
Enchanting novelty, that moon at full<br />
That finds out every crevice of the head<br />
That is not sound and perfect, hath in theirs<br />
Wrought this disturbance.&nbsp; But the wane is near,<br />
And his own cattle must suffice him soon.<br />
Thus idly do we waste the breath of praise,<br />
And dedicate a tribute, in its use<br />
And just direction sacred, to a thing<br />
Doomed to the dust, or lodged already there.<br />
Encomium in old time was poet&rsquo;s work;<br />
But, poets having lavishly long since<br />
Exhausted all materials of the art,<br />
The task now falls into the public hand;<br />
And I, contented with a humble theme,<br />
Have poured my stream of panegyric down<br />
The vale of Nature, where it creeps and winds<br />
Among her lovely works, with a secure<br />
And unambitious course, reflecting clear<br />
If not the virtues yet the worth of brutes.<br />
And I am recompensed, and deem the toil<br />
Of poetry not lost, if verse of mine<br />
May stand between an animal and woe,<br />
And teach one tyrant pity for his drudge.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groans of Nature in this
nether world,<br />
Which Heaven has heard for ages, have an end.<br />
Foretold by prophets, and by poets sung,<br />
Whose fire was kindled at the prophets&rsquo; lamp,<br />
The time of rest, the promised Sabbath, comes.<br />
Six thousand years of sorrow have well-nigh<br />
Fulfilled their tardy and disastrous course<br />
Over a sinful world; and what remains<br />
Of this tempestuous state of human things,<br />
Is merely as the working of a sea<br />
Before a calm, that rocks itself to rest.<br />
For He, whose car the winds are, and the clouds<br />
The dust that waits upon His sultry march,<br />
When sin hath moved Him, and His wrath is hot,<br />
Shall visit earth in mercy; shall descend<br />
Propitious, in His chariot paved with love,<br />
And what His storms have blasted and defaced<br />
For man&rsquo;s revolt, shall with a smile repair.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet is the harp of
prophecy; too sweet<br />
Not to be wronged by a mere mortal touch;<br />
Nor can the wonders it records be sung<br />
To meaner music, and not suffer loss.<br />
But when a poet, or when one like me,<br />
Happy to rove among poetic flowers,<br />
Though poor in skill to rear them, lights at last<br />
On some fair theme, some theme divinely fair,<br />
Such is the impulse and the spur he feels<br />
To give it praise proportioned to its worth,<br />
That not to attempt it, arduous as he deems<br />
The labour, were a task more arduous still.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh scenes surpassing fable,
and yet true,<br />
Scenes of accomplished bliss! which who can see,<br />
Though but in distant prospect, and not feel<br />
His soul refreshed with foretaste of the joy?<br />
Rivers of gladness water all the earth,<br />
And clothe all climes with beauty; the reproach<br />
Of barrenness is past.&nbsp; The fruitful field<br />
Laughs with abundance, and the land once lean,<br />
Or fertile only in its own disgrace,<br />
Exults to see its thistly curse repealed.<br />
The various seasons woven into one,<br />
And that one season an eternal spring,<br />
The garden fears no blight, and needs no fence,<br />
For there is none to covet, all are full.<br />
The lion and the libbard and the bear<br />
Graze with the fearless flocks.&nbsp; All bask at noon<br />
Together, or all gambol in the shade<br />
Of the same grove, and drink one common stream.<br />
Antipathies are none.&nbsp; No foe to man<br />
Lurks in the serpent now.&nbsp; The mother sees,<br />
And smiles to see, her infant&rsquo;s playful hand<br />
Stretched forth to dally with the crested worm,<br />
To stroke his azure neck, or to receive<br />
The lambent homage of his arrowy tongue.<br />
All creatures worship man, and all mankind<br />
One Lord, one Father.&nbsp; Error has no place;<br />
That creeping pestilence is driven away,<br />
The breath of heaven has chased it.&nbsp; In the heart<br />
No passion touches a discordant string,<br />
But all is harmony and love.&nbsp; Disease<br />
Is not.&nbsp; The pure and uncontaminated blood<br />
Holds its due course, nor fears the frost of age.<br />
One song employs all nations; and all cry,<br />
&ldquo;Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain for us!&rdquo;<br />
The dwellers in the vales and on the rocks<br />
Shout to each other, and the mountain-tops<br />
From distant mountains catch the flying joy,<br />
Till nation after nation taught the strain,<br />
Each rolls the rapturous Hosanna round.<br />
Behold the measure of the promise filled,<br />
See Salem built, the labour of a God!<br />
Bright as a sun the sacred city shines;<br />
All kingdoms and all princes of the earth<br />
Flock to that light; the glory of all lands<br />
Flows into her, unbounded is her joy<br />
And endless her increase.&nbsp; Thy rams are there,<br />
Nebaioth, <a name="citation170"></a><a href="#footnote170"
class="citation">[170]</a> and the flocks of Kedar there;<br />
The looms of Ormus, and the mines of Ind,<br />
And Saba&rsquo;s spicy groves pay tribute there.<br />
Praise is in all her gates.&nbsp; Upon her walls,<br />
And in her streets, and in her spacious courts<br />
Is heard salvation.&nbsp; Eastern Java there<br />
Kneels with the native of the farthest West,<br />
And &AElig;thiopia spreads abroad the hand,<br />
And worships.&nbsp; Her report has travelled forth<br />
Into all lands.&nbsp; From every clime they come<br />
To see thy beauty and to share thy joy,<br />
O Sion! an assembly such as earth<br />
Saw never; such as heaven stoops down to see.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus heavenward all things
tend.&nbsp; For all were once<br />
Perfect, and all must be at length restored.<br />
So God has greatly purposed; who would else<br />
In His dishonoured works Himself endure<br />
Dishonour, and be wronged without redress.<br />
Haste then, and wheel away a shattered world,<br />
Ye slow-revolving seasons!&nbsp; We would see<br />
(A sight to which our eyes are strangers yet)<br />
A world that does not dread and hate His laws,<br />
And suffer for its crime: would learn how fair<br />
The creature is that God pronounces good,<br />
How pleasant in itself what pleases Him.<br />
Here every drop of honey hides a sting;<br />
Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flowers,<br />
And even the joy, that haply some poor heart<br />
Derives from heaven, pure as the fountain is,<br />
Is sullied in the stream; taking a taint<br />
From touch of human lips, at best impure.<br />
Oh for a world in principle as chaste<br />
As this is gross and selfish! over which<br />
Custom and prejudice shall bear no sway,<br />
That govern all things here, shouldering aside<br />
The meek and modest Truth, and forcing her<br />
To seek a refuge from the tongue of strife<br />
In nooks obscure, far from the ways of men,<br />
Where violence shall never lift the sword,<br />
Nor cunning justify the proud man&rsquo;s wrong,<br />
Leaving the poor no remedy but tears;<br />
Where he that fills an office, shall esteem<br />
The occasion it presents of doing good<br />
More than the perquisite; where laws shall speak<br />
Seldom, and never but as wisdom prompts,<br />
And equity, not jealous more to guard<br />
A worthless form, than to decide aright;<br />
Where fashion shall not sanctify abuse,<br />
Nor smooth good-breeding (supplemental grace)<br />
With lean performance ape the work of love.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come then, and added to Thy
many crowns<br />
Receive yet one, the crown of all the earth,<br />
Thou who alone art worthy! it was Thine<br />
By ancient covenant, ere nature&rsquo;s birth,<br />
And Thou hast made it Thine by purchase since,<br />
And overpaid its value with Thy blood.<br />
Thy saints proclaim Thee King; and in their hearts<br />
Thy title is engraven with a pen<br />
Dipt in the fountain of eternal love.<br />
Thy saints proclaim Thee King; and Thy delay<br />
Gives courage to their foes, who, could they see<br />
The dawn of Thy last advent, long-desired,<br />
Would creep into the bowels of the hills,<br />
And flee for safety to the falling rocks.<br />
The very spirit of the world is tired<br />
Of its own taunting question, asked so long,<br />
&ldquo;Where is the promise of your Lord&rsquo;s
approach?&rdquo;<br />
The infidel has shot his bolts away,<br />
Till, his exhausted quiver yielding none,<br />
He gleans the blunted shafts that have recoiled,<br />
And aims them at the shield of truth again.<br />
The veil is rent, rent too by priestly hands,<br />
That hides divinity from mortal eyes;<br />
And all the mysteries to faith proposed,<br />
Insulted and traduced, are cast aside,<br />
As useless, to the moles and to the bats.<br />
They now are deemed the faithful and are praised,<br />
Who, constant only in rejecting Thee,<br />
Deny Thy Godhead with a martyr&rsquo;s zeal,<br />
And quit their office for their error&rsquo;s sake.<br />
Blind and in love with darkness! yet even these<br />
Worthy, compared with sycophants, who kneel,<br />
Thy Name adoring, and then preach Thee man!<br />
So fares Thy Church.&nbsp; But how Thy Church may fare,<br />
The world takes little thought; who will may preach,<br />
And what they will.&nbsp; All pastors are alike<br />
To wandering sheep resolved to follow none.<br />
Two gods divide them all, Pleasure and Gain;<br />
For these they live, they sacrifice to these,<br />
And in their service wage perpetual war<br />
With conscience and with Thee.&nbsp; Lust in their hearts,<br />
And mischief in their hands, they roam the earth<br />
To prey upon each other; stubborn, fierce,<br />
High-minded, foaming out their own disgrace.<br />
Thy prophets speak of such; and noting down<br />
The features of the last degenerate times,<br />
Exhibit every lineament of these.<br />
Come then, and added to Thy many crowns<br />
Receive yet one as radiant as the rest,<br />
Due to Thy last and most effectual work,<br />
Thy Word fulfilled, the conquest of a world.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the happy man, whose
life even now<br />
Shows somewhat of that happier life to come;<br />
Who, doomed to an obscure but tranquil state,<br />
Is pleased with it, and, were he free to choose,<br />
Would make his fate his choice; whom peace, the fruit<br />
Of virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of faith,<br />
Prepare for happiness; bespeak him one<br />
Content indeed to sojourn while he must<br />
Below the skies, but having there his home.<br />
The world o&rsquo;erlooks him in her busy search<br />
Of objects more illustrious in her view;<br />
And occupied as earnestly as she,<br />
Though more sublimely, he o&rsquo;erlooks the world.<br />
She scorns his pleasures, for she knows them not;<br />
He seeks not hers, for he has proved them vain.<br />
He cannot skim the ground like summer birds<br />
Pursuing gilded flies, and such he deems<br />
Her honours, her emoluments, her joys;<br />
Therefore in contemplation is his bliss,<br />
Whose power is such, that whom she lifts from earth<br />
She makes familiar with a heaven unseen,<br />
And shows him glories yet to be revealed.<br />
Not slothful he, though seeming unemployed,<br />
And censured oft as useless.&nbsp; Stillest streams<br />
Oft water fairest meadows; and the bird<br />
That flutters least is longest on the wing.<br />
Ask him, indeed, what trophies he has raised,<br />
Or what achievements of immortal fame<br />
He purposes, and he shall answer&mdash;None.<br />
His warfare is within.&nbsp; There unfatigued<br />
His fervent spirit labours.&nbsp; There he fights,<br />
And there obtains fresh triumphs o&rsquo;er himself,<br />
And never-withering wreaths, compared with which<br />
The laurels that a C&aelig;sar reaps are weeds.<br />
Perhaps the self-approving haughty world,<br />
That, as she sweeps him with her whistling silks,<br />
Scarce deigns to notice him, or if she see,<br />
Deems him a cipher in the works of God,<br />
Receives advantage from his noiseless hours<br />
Of which she little dreams.&nbsp; Perhaps she owes<br />
Her sunshine and her rain, her blooming spring<br />
And plenteous harvest, to the prayer he makes<br />
When, Isaac-like, the solitary saint<br />
Walks forth to meditate at eventide,<br />
And think on her who thinks not for herself.<br />
Forgive him then, thou bustler in concerns<br />
Of little worth, and idler in the best,<br />
If, author of no mischief and some good,<br />
He seeks his proper happiness by means<br />
That may advance, but cannot hinder thine.<br />
Nor, though he tread the secret path of life,<br />
Engage no notice, and enjoy much ease,<br />
Account him an encumbrance on the state,<br />
Receiving benefits, and rendering none.<br />
His sphere though humble, if that humble sphere<br />
Shine with his fair example, and though small<br />
His influence, if that influence all be spent<br />
In soothing sorrow and in quenching strife,<br />
In aiding helpless indigence, in works<br />
From which at least a grateful few derive<br />
Some taste of comfort in a world of woe,<br />
Then let the supercilious great confess<br />
He serves his country; recompenses well<br />
The state beneath the shadow of whose vine<br />
He sits secure, and in the scale of life<br />
Holds no ignoble, though a slighted place.<br />
The man whose virtues are more felt than seen,<br />
Must drop, indeed, the hope of public praise;<br />
But he may boast, what few that win it can,<br />
That if his country stand not by his skill,<br />
At least his follies have not wrought her fall.<br />
Polite refinement offers him in vain<br />
Her golden tube, through which a sensual world<br />
Draws gross impurity, and likes it well,<br />
The neat conveyance hiding all the offence.<br />
Not that he peevishly rejects a mode<br />
Because that world adopts it.&nbsp; If it bear<br />
The stamp and clear impression of good sense,<br />
And be not costly more than of true worth,<br />
He puts it on, and for decorum sake<br />
Can wear it e&rsquo;en as gracefully as she.<br />
She judges of refinement by the eye,<br />
He by the test of conscience, and a heart<br />
Not soon deceived; aware that what is base<br />
No polish can make sterling, and that vice,<br />
Though well-perfumed and elegantly dressed,<br />
Like an unburied carcass tricked with flowers,<br />
Is but a garnished nuisance, fitter far<br />
For cleanly riddance than for fair attire.<br />
So life glides smoothly and by stealth away,<br />
More golden than that age of fabled gold<br />
Renowned in ancient song; not vexed with care,<br />
Or stained with guilt, beneficent, approved<br />
Of God and man, and peaceful in its end.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So glide my life away! and so
at last,<br />
My share of duties decently fulfilled,<br />
May some disease, not tardy to perform<br />
Its destined office, yet with gentle stroke,<br />
Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat<br />
Beneath the turf that I have often trod.<br />
It shall not grieve me, then, that once, when called<br />
To dress a Sofa with the flowers of verse,<br />
I played awhile, obedient to the fair,<br />
With that light task, but soon to please her more,<br />
Whom flowers alone I knew would little please,<br />
Let fall the unfinished wreath, and roved for fruit;<br />
Roved far and gathered much; some harsh, &rsquo;tis true,<br />
Picked from the thorns and briars of reproof,<br />
But wholesome, well-digested; grateful some<br />
To palates that can taste immortal truth;<br />
Insipid else, and sure to be despised.<br />
But all is in His hand whose praise I seek,<br />
In vain the poet sings, and the world hears,<br />
If He regard not, though divine the theme.<br />
&rsquo;Tis not in artful measures, in the chime<br />
And idle tinkling of a minstrel&rsquo;s lyre,<br />
To charm His ear, whose eye is on the heart;<br />
Whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain,<br />
Whose approbation&mdash;prosper even mine.</p>
<h2>THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN;</h2>
<p style="text-align: center" class="gutsumm"><span
class="GutSmall">SHOWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE
INTENDED,</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN.</span></p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">John Gilpin</span> was a
citizen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of credit and renown,<br />
A train-band captain eke was he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of famous London town.</p>
<p class="poetry">John Gilpin&rsquo;s spouse said to her dear,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Though wedded we have been<br />
These twice ten tedious years, yet we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No holiday have seen.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;To-morrow is our wedding-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we will then repair<br />
Unto &lsquo;The Bell&rsquo; at Edmonton,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All in a chaise and pair.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;My sister and my sister&rsquo;s
child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Myself and children three,<br />
Will fill the chaise; so you must ride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On horseback after we.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He soon replied, &ldquo;I do admire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of womankind but one,<br />
And you are she, my dearest dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore it shall be done.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I am a linen-draper bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As all the world doth know,<br />
And my good friend the Calender<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will lend his horse to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Quoth Mistress Gilpin, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well
said;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, for that wine is dear,<br />
We will be furnished with our own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is both bright and clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;erjoyed was he to find<br />
That though on pleasure she was bent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She had a frugal mind.</p>
<p class="poetry">The morning came, the chaise was brought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But yet was not allowed<br />
To drive up to the door, lest all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should say that she was proud.</p>
<p class="poetry">So three doors off the chaise was stayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they did all get in;<br />
Six precious souls, and all agog<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To dash through thick and thin.</p>
<p class="poetry">Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were never folk so glad;<br />
The stones did rattle underneath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if Cheapside were mad.</p>
<p class="poetry">John Gilpin at his horse&rsquo;s side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seized fast the flowing mane,<br />
And up he got, in haste to ride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But soon came down again;</p>
<p class="poetry">For saddle-tree scarce reached had he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His journey to begin,<br />
When, turning round his head, he saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Three customers come in.</p>
<p class="poetry">So down he came; for loss of time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it grieved him sore,<br />
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would trouble him much more.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twas long before the customers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were suited to their mind.<br />
When Betty, screaming, came down stairs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The wine is left behind!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Good lack!&rdquo; quoth he; &ldquo;yet
bring it me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My leathern belt likewise,<br />
In which I bear my trusty sword,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I do exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had two stone bottles found,<br />
To hold the liquor that she loved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep it safe and sound.</p>
<p class="poetry">Each bottle had a curling ear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through which the belt he drew,<br />
And hung a bottle on each side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make his balance true.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then over all, that he might be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Equipped from top to toe,<br />
His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He manfully did throw.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now see him mounted once again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon his nimble steed,<br />
Full slowly pacing o&rsquo;er the stones<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With caution and good heed!</p>
<p class="poetry">But, finding soon a smoother road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath his well-shod feet,<br />
The snorting beast began to trot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which galled him in his seat.</p>
<p class="poetry">So, &ldquo;Fair and softly,&rdquo; John he
cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But John he cried in vain;<br />
That trot became a gallop soon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of curb and rein.</p>
<p class="poetry">So stooping down, as needs he must<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who cannot sit upright,<br />
He grasped the mane with both his hands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And eke with all his might.</p>
<p class="poetry">His horse, who never in that sort<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had handled been before,<br />
What thing upon his back had got<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did wonder more and more.</p>
<p class="poetry">Away went Gilpin, neck or naught;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Away went hat and wig;<br />
He little dreamt, when he set out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of running such a rig.</p>
<p class="poetry">The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like streamer long and gay,<br />
Till, loop and button failing both,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At last it flew away.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then might all people well discern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottles he had slung;<br />
A bottle swinging at each side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As hath been said or sung.</p>
<p class="poetry">The dogs did bark, the children screamed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up flew the windows all;<br />
And every soul cried out, &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As loud as he could bawl.</p>
<p class="poetry">Away went Gilpin&mdash;who but he?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His fame soon spread around&mdash;<br />
He carries weight! he rides a race!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis for a thousand pound!</p>
<p class="poetry">And still, as fast as he drew near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas wonderful to view<br />
How in a trice the turnpike men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their gates wide open threw.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now, as he went bowing down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His reeking head full low,<br />
The bottles twain behind his back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were shattered at a blow.</p>
<p class="poetry">Down ran the wine into the road,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most piteous to be seen,<br />
Which made his horse&rsquo;s flanks to smoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As they had basted been.</p>
<p class="poetry">But still he seemed to carry weight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With leathern girdle braced;<br />
For all might see the bottle-necks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still dangling at his waist.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus all through merry Islington<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These gambols he did play,<br />
And till he came unto the Wash<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Edmonton so gay.</p>
<p class="poetry">And there he threw the wash about<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On both sides of the way,<br />
Just like unto a trundling mop,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or a wild goose at play.</p>
<p class="poetry">At Edmonton, his loving wife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the bal-cony spied<br />
Her tender husband, wondering much<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see how he did ride.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Stop, stop, John
Gilpin!&mdash;here&rsquo;s the house!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They all at once did cry;<br />
&ldquo;The dinner waits, and we are tired.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Gilpin, &ldquo;So am I!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">But yet his horse was not a whit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Inclined to tarry there;<br />
For why?&mdash;his owner had a house<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full ten miles off, at Ware.</p>
<p class="poetry">So like an arrow swift he flew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shot by an archer strong;<br />
So did he fly&mdash;which brings me to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle of my song.</p>
<p class="poetry">Away went Gilpin, out of breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sore against his will,<br />
Till at his friend the Calender&rsquo;s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His horse at last stood still.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Calender, amazed to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His neighbour in such trim,<br />
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus accosted him:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What news? what news? your tidings
tell:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me you must and shall&mdash;<br />
Say why bareheaded you are come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or why you come at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And loved a timely joke;<br />
And thus unto the Calender<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In merry guise he spoke:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I came because your horse would come;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And if I well forebode,<br />
My hat and wig will soon be here;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They are upon the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Calender, right glad to find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His friend in merry pin,<br />
Returned him not a single word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But to the house went in;</p>
<p class="poetry">Whence straight he came with hat and wig,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A wig that flowed behind,<br />
A hat not much the worse for wear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each comely in its kind.</p>
<p class="poetry">He held them up, and, in his turn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus showed his ready wit,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;My head is twice as big as yours;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They therefore needs must fit.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;But let me scrape the dirt away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That hangs upon your face;<br />
And stop and eat, for well you may<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be in a hungry case.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Says John, &ldquo;It is my wedding-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the world would stare,<br />
If wife should dine at Edmonton,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I should dine at Ware.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So turning to his horse, he said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am in haste to dine;<br />
&rsquo;Twas for your pleasure you came here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall go back for mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For which he paid full dear;<br />
For while he spake, a braying ass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did sing most loud and clear;</p>
<p class="poetry">Whereat his horse did snort as he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had heard a lion roar,<br />
And galloped off with all his might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As he had done before.</p>
<p class="poetry">Away went Gilpin, and away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went Gilpin&rsquo;s hat and wig;<br />
He lost them sooner than at first,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For why?&mdash;they were too big.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband posting down<br />
Into the country far away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She pulled out half-a-crown.</p>
<p class="poetry">And thus unto the youth she said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That drove them to &ldquo;The Bell,&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;This shall be yours when you bring back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband safe and well.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The youth did ride, and soon did meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; John coming back amain,<br />
Whom in a trice he tried to stop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By catching at his rein;</p>
<p class="poetry">But not performing what he meant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gladly would have done,<br />
The frighted steed he frighted more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And made him faster run.</p>
<p class="poetry">Away went Gilpin, and away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went postboy at his heels,<br />
The postboy&rsquo;s horse right glad to miss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lumbering of the wheels.</p>
<p class="poetry">Six gentlemen upon the road<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus seeing Gilpin fly,<br />
With postboy scampering in the rear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They raised the hue and cry:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Stop thief! stop thief!&mdash;a
highwayman!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not one of them was mute;<br />
And all and each that passed that way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did join in the pursuit.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now the turnpike gates again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flew open in short space,<br />
The tollmen thinking, as before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Gilpin rode a race.</p>
<p class="poetry">And so he did, and won it too,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he got first to town;<br />
Nor stopped till where he had got up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He did again get down.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now let us sing, &ldquo;Long live the king,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Gilpin, long live he;<br />
And when he next doth ride abroad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May I be there to see!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>AN EPISTLE TO JOSEPH HILL, ESQ.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Dear
Joseph</span>,&mdash;five and twenty years ago&mdash;<br />
Alas, how time escapes!&mdash;&rsquo;tis even so&mdash;<br />
With frequent intercourse, and always sweet<br />
And always friendly, we were wont to cheat<br />
A tedious hour&mdash;and now we never meet.<br />
As some grave gentleman in Terence says<br />
(&rsquo;Twas therefore much the same in ancient days),<br />
&ldquo;Good lack, we know not what to-morrow brings&mdash;<br />
Strange fluctuation of all human things!&rdquo;<br />
True.&nbsp; Changes will befall, and friends may part,<br />
But distance only cannot change the heart:<br />
And were I called to prove the assertion true,<br />
One proof should serve&mdash;a reference to you.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence comes it, then, that
in the wane of life,<br />
Though nothing have occurred to kindle strife,<br />
We find the friends we fancied we had won,<br />
Though numerous once, reduced to few or none?<br />
Can gold grow worthless that has stood the touch?<br />
No.&nbsp; Gold they seemed, but they were never such.<br />
Horatio&rsquo;s servant once, with bow and cringe,<br />
Swinging the parlour-door upon its hinge,<br />
Dreading a negative, and overawed<br />
Lest he should trespass, begged to go abroad.<br />
&ldquo;Go, fellow!&mdash;whither?&rdquo;&mdash;turning short
about&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Nay.&nbsp; Stay at home; you&rsquo;re always going
out.&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis but a step, sir; just at the street&rsquo;s
end.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;An please you, sir, to see a
friend.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;A friend!&rdquo; Horatio cried, and seemed to start;<br />
&ldquo;Yea, marry shalt thou, and with all my heart&mdash;<br />
And fetch my cloak, for though the night be raw<br />
I&rsquo;ll see him too&mdash;the first I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew the man, and knew his
nature mild,<br />
And was his plaything often when a child;<br />
But somewhat at that moment pinched him close,<br />
Else he was seldom bitter or morose.<br />
Perhaps, his confidence just then betrayed,<br />
His grief might prompt him with the speech he made;<br />
Perhaps &rsquo;twas mere good-humour gave it birth,<br />
The harmless play of pleasantry and mirth.<br />
Howe&rsquo;er it was, his language in my mind<br />
Bespoke at least a man that knew mankind.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not to moralise too much,
and strain<br />
To prove an evil of which all complain<br />
(I hate long arguments, verbosely spun),<br />
One story more, dear Hill, and I have done.<br />
Once on a time, an emperor, a wise man.<br />
No matter where, in China or Japan,<br />
Decreed that whosoever should offend<br />
Against the well-known duties of a friend,<br />
Convicted once, should ever after wear<br />
But half a coat, and show his bosom bare;<br />
The punishment importing this, no doubt,<br />
That all was naught within and all found out.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh happy Britain! we have not
to fear<br />
Such hard and arbitrary measure here;<br />
Else could a law, like that which I relate,<br />
Once have the sanction of our triple state,<br />
Some few that I have known in days of old<br />
Would run most dreadful risk of catching cold.<br />
While you, my friend, whatever wind should blow,<br />
Might traverse England safely to and fro,<br />
An honest man, close buttoned to the chin,<br />
Broad-cloth without, and a warm heart within.</p>
<h2>TO MARY.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> twentieth year
is well-nigh past<br />
Since first our sky was overcast,<br />
Ah, would that this might be the last!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">Thy spirits have a fainter flow,<br />
I see thee daily weaker grow&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Twas my distress that brought thee low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">Thy needles, once a shining store,<br />
For my sake restless heretofore,<br />
Now rust disused, and shine no more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">For though thou gladly wouldst fulfil<br />
The same kind office for me still,<br />
Thy sight now seconds not thy will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">But well thou playedst the housewife&rsquo;s
part,<br />
And all thy threads with magic art<br />
Have wound themselves about this heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">Thy indistinct expressions seem<br />
Like language uttered in a dream;<br />
Yet me they charm, whate&rsquo;er the theme,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">Thy silver locks, once auburn bright,<br />
Are still more lovely in my sight<br />
Than golden beams of orient light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">For could I view nor them nor thee,<br />
What sight worth seeing could I see?<br />
The sun would rise in vain for me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">Partakers of thy sad decline,<br />
Thy hands their little force resign;<br />
Yet gently prest, press gently mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">Such feebleness of limbs thou prov&rsquo;st,<br
/>
That now at every step thou mov&rsquo;st<br />
Upheld by two, yet still thou lov&rsquo;st,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">And still to love, though prest with ill,<br />
In wintry age to feel no chill,<br />
With me, is to be lovely still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">But ah! by constant heed I know,<br />
How oft the sadness that I show,<br />
Transforms thy smiles to looks of woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>
<p class="poetry">And should my future lot be cast<br />
With much resemblance of the past,<br />
Thy worn-out heart will break at last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Mary!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
